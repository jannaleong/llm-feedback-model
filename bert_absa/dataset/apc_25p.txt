Not a hard course if you go to class and listen to the prof( Bill Bishop). Too many $T$ to cram, but they are a strong resource, especially if you annotate them during lectures. Plenty of past midterms and exams but don't expect a really high mark just from those. A lot of content that can be dry at times, but overall an enjoyable course. Labs are very long and can go wrong just about anywhere if not set up properly so get help from the TA's while you can.

The most useless $T$ I've ever taken. The standards for the assignments are ridiculously low. You'd think in a design class, you'd learn how to design / plan / implement projects were economically or, at very least, physically feasible, but that really wasn't the case. Many of the groups that retrieved high marks had issues with hindering their entire designs on technologies that did not yet exist, were clearly economically unfeasible, or didn't really solve the problem they were tasked to solve. The first two out of three major projects were designing a poster and re-design of a room/ space. The course really wasn't challenging, didn't introduce any novel material about design or design strategies, and no real concern seemed to go towards the viability of designs / solutions.

Arrogant , inconsiderate , and unreasonable. For a professor teaching argumentation, $T$ employs textbook fallacies against his own students. Assignment expectations are vague and understated, marks aggressively like he has a personal vendetta with his students, and will not , under any circumstance , yield to alternative justified reasoning. Everything besides his opinions is wrong and irrelevant in his eyes. For any student taking this course outside of their major as an elective, your intelligence will be shamed and disregarded in favor of the subjective flavor of" common sense" the professor employs. A near unwavering offline class consensus was reached on the disapproval of this professor. However, the course itself is somewhat useful in all real-life forms of communication, so I recommend it but stay away from this prof.

$T$ pretty easy, then ramped up right around midterm season and then by the end it was getting pretty theoretical. If you don't know something, ask, because there's a really good chance that the small details you don't understand will come up later on, especially when you start getting into the parts of making your own assembler, compiler, and things in Racket. Speaking of which, this course made me appreciate Racket more:)

The $T$ are the * bare minimum * you need to take this course. The material regularly involves upper-year optimization / statistics content which is only covered in 1 or 2 review lectures at the beginning. With Yaoliang, the material was very theoretical and mathematical, and I only understood 50 % of the content--- enough to have an intuitive understanding of the concepts, but not enough to really understand all of the proofs presented in the lectures. Fortunately, this was enough to get a grade of 90+. For the students who want to go further and gain a deeper understanding, the professor was very helpful in answering questions and providing pointers/ resources on Piazza.

Teaching proof techniques is the main focus of the course, and is done quite well-- but all the topics that we touched on( gcd, complex numbers, modular arithmetic), were interesting too! One assignment a week, which usually took 3-6 hours, plus three Mobius quizzes a week, open for 24 hours each. The midterm was challenging but still fair, and the final was much easier. My only regret is not taking MATH 145 instead. If you are anywhere near the Euclid score cutoff, you should apply for the advanced courses instead-- you will likely find 135 to be fairly easy.

$T$ is interesting and quite in depth. Basically split between linear regression and time series. Not a easy course. If this is the first stats course you took( stat230/231 are not really real stats courses), then you will need to get used to how its not super structured like before where you have lots of samples to study from and really dig into the material. I found this to be exponentially harder than 230/231 and require some concepts of 235/237 which should be prerequisites really.

may I start from the fact that this is one Handsome $T$. If that doesn't motivate you enough to be on your best behaviour in class and work hard, here's more.

One of the most tedious classes I've ever taken, I've learned nothing about auditing. He tries to make accounting philosophical, which it clearly is not.

Easiest $T$ I've ever taken in my life( including high school). I did take band through grade 9-12 in high school though, so I did have a little background information which helped a bit for the first quiz.

Because of covid, we had around 5 days- 1 week to finish all the quizzes and tests and exam so it was very doable. Breakdown: listening quiz( 15%), midterm test( 25%), 2 concert reviews( each 10%), final exam( 40%). Concert reviews are participation, just hit all the points and you get 100%. I finished the course with a 98. I definitely recommend it if you have even the tiniest interest in" classical music". It was enjoyable and easy.

Constructive criticism can be very helpful in a legal writing course. However, don't expect to get any of that in $T$. She is spiteful , rude , and condescending. She goes out of her way to intentionally confuse and mislead her students. Her lectures are absolutely worthless; she uses them as an opportunity to hear herself speak.

$T$ is a great prof. That is assuming you can handle and are not offended by his obvious and never ending sexual innuendo throughout the course. That is also assuming you are a female thus having no problem with 75 % of the course being based on the " female experience " and how terrible the male gender is. Other than that he marks hard as well.

$T$ is a very smart , intellectual man who has clearly had a lot of experience within the business world.

I don't know how this course has such a high useful rating. It was the most useless $T$ I've ever taken. I went to only one lecture and I am still sad that I lost 50 minutes of my life on that. The assignments are not illuminating in the slightest, and are only worth doing because they're 40 % of your grade.

Read syllabus, watch videos, and read his documents of what he requires of you. $T$ will tell you how to get a good grade. It's not hard! I didn't read one chapter, just reviewed the titles of the paragraphs and used the index to answer test questions. Tests are 10 questions with 20 min time limit. Exams are a bit tricky.

The $T$ knows his stuff. That doesn't mean he should teach. I don't deny his genius, but I am not fond of his methods. The rehearsal room is supposed to be a safe place. I felt it to be a courtroom. Listen to him, but don't let him kill your spirit or love of acting. I learned that the hard way. There are amazing directors out there that do support

He is my favorite $T$! He really knows the material and knows how to deliver it well for students to understand. He cares about his students and does not give a lot of homework at all. He gives long PowerPoint lectures but he keeps you interested. Definitely recommend to take him!

The $T$ for the course is pretty interesting. You get to learn about a lot of different data structures and algorithms. The assignments are pretty easy to get high marks on, but the midterm and final are pretty tough. You should definitely attend lectures for this class because some of the data structures / algorithms are way easier to understand in lectures than from just the slides. Compared to either, the course notes are terrible for learning the material, they are written like Calc course notes( very mathematical and hard to understand from reading).

Really good $T$ if you're at all interested in agriculture/ our food system and how it works. The textbook readings are often a quite a few chapters each week, but interesting textbook overall, just skim it to be prepared for lecture. Course is weighted quite heavily though- 25% midterm, 25% assignment and 40% final, so you need to know your stuff for the tests. Most of the content you need is on the slides, so take good notes and pay attention to the documentaries, because they are tested as well.

Broad range of $T$ to being, but quickly narrows down. The concepts and the understanding is fairly easy if you pay attention and go to class( or watch the lecture videos). Can be very " mathy " but there are many tips in tricks to figure out if your struggle with math. An 100 % is very attainable.

$T$ is very demanding but rightfully so-- she puts a lot of effort into her teaching and expects just as much back. She is a very strict , but reasonable grader. Don't try to BS your way through an essay or exam because she'll spot it a mile away. Awesome professor-- much learned-- I feel very disciplined and stronger.

DO NOT TAKE $T$! I repeat, DO NOT take Ovanessian. She is rude and acts like she doesn't want to be there. She gives WAY too much work and moves at an incredibly fast pace for the level we are at. She is hard to understand, and does NOT explain things clearly at all. The class has a very frustrating vibe. She acts like a drill instructor.

I'm not sure what constitutes a good $T$, but she does make you get up in front of the class and give five or six speeches over the course of the semester. This allows you to get more comfortable with being in the spotlight and talking, which really helped my public speaking skills( and hopefully your's as well).

He's extremely engaging and knowledgeable about the world of art history. $T$ knows so much info it's impossible not to learn something if you go. Attendance isn't completely mandatory but he does keep track. Tests are super hard but if you go and study you be able to pull at least a B or C. He's also kind of goofy.

I can tell you with certainty that watching paint dry would be more interesting than attending a lecture by $T$. He is an awkward man who is probably a genius but has no communication skills. His bias shines through when he marks papers- and he takes attendance so you have no option but to go and be bored to death. AVOID.

One of the best $T$ I've taken in the C& O department. It's structured in a non-traditional way; there are no weekly lectures, rather there are full course notes and links to Martin Pei's videos. The professor states exactly which pieces of content are relevant for the current week's assignment. It was clear to me that the professor cared more about students actually learning the course content instead of attempting to maintain some arbitrary class average through insanely difficult and time-consuming assessments. The course requires mild , but consistent effort. The assignments were enjoyable and well-designed; the purpose seemed to be to really push us to dig into the proofs in the course notes, reinforce the topics, and build some intuition. If you've taken any other C& O course with a difficult professor, these assignments will seem much easier, mostly because the others are overtuned. The notation in the course notes was mildly annoying to parse through at times, but it was serviceable nonetheless. Heavily dependent on the professor; Martin Pei's course is structured entirely differently with much more difficult assessments. Also, Joseph Cheriyan gives very thorough and helpful Piazza responses, the most I've ever seen. Granted, he is very strict regarding Piazza posting etiquettes( namely, private posts).

This course was very interesting and useful for Rec students. Some of the marking was a little weird because of the $T$, but if you ask about your mark and have a good reason for wanting it raised then it usually is boosted a bit. I liked the external components like the retreat and the program implementation at the YMCA

Absolutely fabulous. $T$ is the best prof I've had this semester. She's engaging and extremely knowledgeable. Her material is interesting and goes way beyond information you may have picked up along the way. Her exams are fair and the topic for the paper was really unique. I'll look for her in the future!

This was a continuation of high school physics with rotational motion, torque, and static equilibrium tossed into the mix. The $T$ were not too difficult to grasp and it was for the most part really interesting. The course consisted of a weekly quiz( which consisted of three questions) on the material covered that week. Thanks to my high school physics background, I could ace all the quizzes without doing the practice questions beforehand. Also were the weekly tutorials. Here you had to write a summary of last week's lectures and do problems with a group. These are optional and I only attended a few but I recommend going to each so that way you get weight shifted off from your final to participation marks. There was one midterm and it was not too bad. I did not study at all for the midterm and still made it out with a decent mark( 79%). The final had some questions that were straightforward but it also had some questions which were pretty brutal, I do not doubt that they curved the grades a bit. Overall it was an interesting course, but I recommend doing the practice problems weekly because cramming for the final was not fun.

Best $T$ I've taken at UW. You learn a ton of useful material, and it's extremely well laid out. Assignments are difficult but if you start them early it's fine.

$T$ is horrible! She has a very thick accent which makes her impossible to understand, her tests / quizzes are hard, she doesn't teach the material, just simply restates what's in the book. I'm basically teaching myself the material. Avoid at all costs.

Took both SPA 101 and 102 with $T$, and would have continued if he'd had higher courses! Class style is straightforward and pleasantly predictable. Prof is helpful and very fair, and uses a lot of different fun activities( loved the cultural presentations!). Pro-tip: do the homework, not for the grade, but because the skills build up quickly.

Very interesting $T$, although unfortunately the last few parts were a bit rushed. The lectures were clear and well made, and the recommended McIntyre textbook is alright too. I appreciate starting with Hilbert spaces and bra-ket notation rather than diving right into wave functions. The assignments and evaluations were very difficult and time consuming and could be pretty difficult though. I found that the best way to prepare for the midterm and final was to just grind out practice problem after practice problem, as it also helped understand the material conceptually. The class was also a bit disorganized in the sense that there seemed to be a disconnect between the TAs and the prof, where at multiple times throughout the course, either during tutorials or while grading assignments, TAs would misjudge what had been covered in the class. Additionally, students who have taken MATH 235 are at an advantage in the sense that a lot of the linear algebra concepts needed such as Hermitian operators is only covered, but this could probably be fixed by taking the first week to review/ introduce these. Overall however, I enjoyed the course.

I appreciate starting with Hilbert spaces and bra-ket notation rather than diving right into wave functions. The assignments and evaluations were very difficult and time consuming and could be pretty difficult though. I found that the best way to prepare for the midterm and final was to just grind out practice problem after practice problem, as it also helped understand the material conceptually. The class was also a bit disorganized in the sense that there seemed to be a disconnect between the TAs and the prof, where at multiple times throughout the course, either during tutorials or while grading assignments, TAs would misjudge what had been covered in the class. Additionally, students who have taken MATH 235 are at an advantage in the sense that a lot of the linear algebra concepts needed such as Hermitian operators is only covered, but this could probably be fixed by taking the first week to review/ introduce these. Overall however, I enjoyed the course.

CHEM 120 is a course that basically all science students have to take. There are 2 midterms and a final. The first midterm is about stoichiometry, which is essentially a lot of calculations and formulas. The 2nd midterm is more theory based and is about things like Lewis structures and periodic trends. The $T$ were both also out of very little( 1st was out of 12, 2nd was out of 16 or 18 iirc), so it can be a little annoying but they were both VERY fair. The content itself can be a little hard to grasp at time, but with practice you will understand. There's also a ton of practice problems available in the course notes and online assignments. Make sure to do the practice problems( especially the ones in the sample midterm) and really understand them because they are often times VERY similar to the ones found on the midterms. The profs for this course will often do review sessions before the midterms and finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice. There is also quite a bit of grade 12 review. If you're thinking about being a keener and buying the textbook, DON'T! Save yourself the money and buy something else!!!! I bought it and barely opened it because we already had so many practice problems available to us. The course notes are basically all you need, and if you have Prof. Sciani, his powerpoint notes are very good too.

$T$ is extremely unorganized and clearly doesn't seem to know how to even use the LEARN system properly. She doesn't post slides for students to follow on LEARN( which is fine normally), but also doesn't post marks to learn , send messages through LEARN. She is clearly technologically incompetent, and doesn't seem to care much about her students ' concerns as she seems rude and unapproachable both in person and through email. It's ironic that this is cross listed with an environment course, yet she wastes so much paper by making sure that everything is done through hardcopy, and even scans and prints copies of scantrons in order to distribute marks. Absolutely ridiculous and a joke of a class.

He's a pretty cool guy , very funny actually. $T$ has a very dark humor and is very cynical. he hates everything especially religion, he talks about sex a lot, so if your easily offended then i wouldn't recommend him. if you dont follow his rules you will have a terrible time in this class. he doesn't give too much homework, and his tests are easy.

Professor Murphy isn't teaching at Vaughn anymore, but I did take $T$ during my first semester in Jan. 2009. It was a memorable class, and Prof. Murphy always challenged his students with fun exercises , papers , and discussions.

Did not like $T$ at all. She's extremely unorganized, rude, grades based on her own opinions. She talks your ear off and says the same things over and over again. Does not explain assignments well and you kind of just have to wing it. She also is constantly marketing her business to her students. Very outdated ideals. Would NOT recommend.

Stupidly easy $T$. Never went and got a mark in the 90s. His lectures are straight out the readings. The tutorials however are nonsense. The mandatory attendance is a garbage rule, if you lose marks for not going that's one thing, but failing the whole component if you miss 2 is absurd. If you get a good TA though it's not terrible, mine let us skip the dumb assignments which was helpful, though I know some TAs made their class stay the whole 90 minutes even if there was nothing left to do.

The $T$ could sometimes be rather extensive, but the book was easy to read and enjoyable. You should probably go to class as he posts the notes, but they are not complete.

$T$ is review from High School. The content should almost be the same as AP Calculus BC. The assignment questions are parodies of what are found in the video lectures, and are not very challenging.

Like most micro courses, if you like the content you'll do well and find it easy , if not , goodluck. The $T$ is not bad though, the dreakdown consisted of a midterm, a partnered term paper an assignment and a final. The midterm was very straightforward( especially since there wasn't tons of content). The paper and assignments were very easy to do well on( 80+); she'll tell you you can't get a good grade leaving them to the last minute but I did both the day before they were due and got 100 on them so don't stress. The final was very fair of the content covered; unfortunately, Barb was replaced halfway through the term by a M . Chaudet who was not the greatest prof in the world. She practically read from the slides without useful elaboration and wasted time trying to encourage students to participate in group discussions rather than getting through the material so we could cover the last ad most interesting topic of the course.

He is tough in that he expects you to put in work. But he also teaches clearly, and he gives extra credit galore. He is funny and personable. Once you get to know him, you'll look forward to sitting in $T$, studying about integrating your hundredth trig polynomial. I didn't even know much of Trig when I first took this. Great professor.

$T$ made art approachable for nearly any student because he isn't trying to make the class hard and confusing.

This was by far my favourite $T$ to date! The content is very interesting, particularly for those with an interest in exploring the microbial world. The content is relatively straightforward, particularly if you've taken cell biology or genetics prior to this course. The mid-term exam and the final exam were both very fair! The content came directly from the slides and from the profs lecture, just be sure to take detailed notes. The textbook( I read each chapter) was helpful, but did not really give any advantage on the exams. Finally, Dr Neufeld is an amazing professor! He is so engaging and is truly passionate about his field. I highly recommend taking the course with him.

horrible $T$ she hardly responds to your emails and is very unclear and critical, she grades unfair don't waist your time but after taking it I felt very discourage she only grades two unanimous chapter analysis, introduction and quizzes the rest of the assignments don't count so the rest of your hard work and time don't count.

" WTF, man I just wanted to learn how to program video games..."- CS365 commenter, 2012
I liked $T$, especially how Scott handled the remote version of this course very well. He got rid of the midterms and did 15 quizzes throughout the term worth 4% each. There were also 4 written assignments, with 10% each. However, I feel as though how well you do on these assignments are dependent on your TA. My TA was very unreasonably strict, and there seems to be no consistency between the marking schemes. If anything, just be wary of that when handing in assignments.

Without a doubt the worst $T$ I've taken at UW in the 7 school terms so far. The contents are completely useless. This is the only course for which learning the materials seems to serve no other purpose than to pass it so that you don't have to deal with it anymore. The assignments can be a lot of grueling work, and the worst part is they do not help you learn anything remotely interesting or useful. Again, the course is completely useless. Recently they changed the course so that you have to base the course project on your FYDP. The problem is that the course materials often don't apply to your FYDP. If you're making a website or a mobile app, you'll probably be fine; but if you are doing anything else( anything unconventional or a little bit creative), it could get pretty absurd and require you to bend over backwards to fit your project into the boxes defined in the course materials. Half way through the term my group changed our project for FYDP, but had to continue making stuff up based on our old project since all the deliverables are based on previous ones. 0/10 would not recommend. Brace yourselves for the suffering.

$T$ is really helpful to build the conception of abstract algebra and I found it interesting. The assignments are not so hard for a second year student but still not easy to get really high. If you just want to get a pmath minor, then don't take this course in a heavy load term because in that case you would not have enough time to absorb the fun parts inside those proofs.

ACTSC 372 Spring 2020 was offered online due to the pandemic. It started out with option pricing models, then NPVs, then CAPM, capital budgeting, and finally capital structure and market efficiency. This $T$ might seem a little all over the place but it is in fact well-suited for someone who is looking for a way into the financial industry. The real world is messy anyways. Recorded lectures were posted each week with the prof doing derivations on a powerpoint slide deck, which is typical ACTSC courses. I selected" did not like" because being a math student at heart, I find the calculations of NPVs and options prices tedious... this in no way means that the course isn't useful. It's still worthwhile. Assessment was bsaed on three take-home assignments and three take-home tests( tests have a deadline of 24 hours after being available). Tests were very long and arduous, but assignments were okay.

Definitely a necessary $T$ for setting the basics for future courses, but content was extremely dense, and much of the course came down to rote memorization( such as very specific reaction pathways). By the way, the course is essentially a copy and paste of CHEM 266, including labs + lecture order, so you can study with friends from ChemE or sciences.

Everything from lectures is straight out of the textbook with Arshi, so as long as you read the textbook and follow her test outlines you don't really need to go to the $T$.

I actually liked $T$ a lot, but it probably has more to do with the prof than the content itself. Prof. Gibson chose really great readings, and I enjoyed getting to peer edit work in class.

It's unfortunate when $T$. Treats the workload as if she is the only class. If you work full time , forget it. Gives a list of curriculum rather than making an actual test review. Posts material late online. She may not be aware she is teaching adults rather than children.

Hey fellow college friend, warning if you want a terrible English teacher than $T$ is the one you want, she is by far the worst English teacher i've ever had, she makes you redo your paper if you get below a C which with her grading you probably will get, she is by far the most boring person i have ever met, please do not take, you're welcome

Not sure if the $T$ was severely dumbed down from previous terms but it was very easy and fair. I previously took and dropped Phys 131L which was WAY harder than this course. I usually walked into the lab without having even looked at the day's experiment and finished with time to spare. For the final, you don't have to memorize the slopes of the graphs if you understand the theory behind them but there's no formula sheet so you will need to remember those.

Well, he will pull questions from those and expect you to know things you can't possible know. He doesn't hit on any key points in lecture; $T$ just powers through 100 slides each class.

$T$ presents the material well, but he does not give a lot of examples unless you ask him to. He is very willing to help if you need it. We had 2 exams and a group research project as our only grads. I highly recommend.

Not a fan of $T$, but don't blame Racket if you do bad. I ended up with 74%, which for a CS major is not really good and I blamed Racket. Racket is possibly one of the best languages for learning recursion so enjoy this course. Extremely useful course, but was difficult for me.

This was my favorite $T$ of 2A Biochem. Although the course is not always straightforward, and it definitely is not easy, it is the only biology course thus far that have asked us to apply our learning. Not just regurgitate knowledge. It has been the most useful course for obtaining co-op positions, and I felt that it's been super useful in future courses. Go to class!! Don't buy the textbook!

Great $T$ for introductory of Analysis. Watch out first years that this is not" AP Calculus" but" Analysis" so unless you want pure math of MF, I do not recommend this course because you can spend you time more effectively on other stuff. Unless you are sure of your ability( Euclid 90 + or IMO medalist), tread lightly.( preview analysis, cardinality, topology)

Like many other labs, this one is highly TA dependent. I always got 95+ on the lab reports but keep in mind that they do adjust the marks higher or lower depending on the course average. Everyone says that the $T$ is hard but I didn't find it so because as long as you read over the lab manual, watch the technique vids on LEARN and know HOW to do the calculations you did in your lab, you're pr much set.

Surprisingly gentle at the start, I thought I'd be screwed for not taking circuits in highschool. $T$ starts to ramp up after midterm once capacitors/ inductors and AC are introduced, however, the difficulty is manageable if you're diligent about doing the ungraded assignments. Midterm / Final difficulty are fair but no pushover, study well, you'll be fine.

I guess it's a good $T$. Basic grade 12 biology you'd learn. Not much else to it. A little disappointed because it was just a big overview of a normal biology course you'd have in high school.

$T$ is a research-based class, so it's not super easy. You have to write one really big research paper, but he breaks it up and makes you start it so that you aren't procrastinating too much. He can get a little boring in class, but he at least has personality. Honors version is take-home tests.

$T$ has mastered the art of the lecture. Read the slides on your own, it's incredibly dry. When you go to lectures, you magically understand everything.

Introductory $T$ to coding, what more can I say? Very easy if you did any programming course in high school or a boot camp online. Otherwise, it's a good course to learn the basics, though it can move a bit quickly. Stay on top of lectures and don't do the assignments last minute unless you're 100% confident in your coding skill.

If you liked GER 101 you gonna like $T$ too. The material is a bit harder and you have to spend a lot of time on this course but I still enjoyed it. Easy to do good if you put an effort. But the wikipedia project was kinda annoying, you have to write in pairs an article in german. It's doable but I don't think that it's useful for the elementary course. I had to google almost every word in order to write this article.

The $T$ take brutally long and was one of the main reasons I struggled to keep up in my other courses this term. However, the assignments are interesting and build upon one another, so you definitely want to aim for perfect on all of them. You can achieve this relatively easily( time consuming , but not too hard). The content is interesting though not necessarily applicable to your work terms. The exams for our term were relatively fair( thought I have some complaints). Overall an 80 + is rather easily achievable if you do the assignments well and really understand the material. I would recommend doing tutorial assignments.

Took $T$ Winter 2022 where half of it was online and in-person. Dr. Woody uploaded all his lectures and audio recordings online, so I managed to get a high 90 in the course without ever coming to class. A textbook is not needed at all. The marking scheme was 20% Mobius assignments( 10 out of 11), 20% written assignments( 10 out of 11) that were group work, 20% midterms( 2 x 10%), 20% project( group work) and 20% final exam.

Although at times the course did lag as we did nothing but confidence interval calculations for weeks at times, but still it is definitely possible to get 90 +.

$T$ is awesome. Math can be dreadful, but this professor explains things so thoroughly, he makes math a walk in the park. I personally hate math, but this professor made it easy for me. If I can pass his class, anyone can.

$T$ are a lot of fun. They are structured in an informal , social manner. Your comprehension and speaking abilities will improve drastically just by being there and participating. He offers clear , often hilarious , explanations of the grammar or any other question you have. If you put in any effort at all and do the homework, you're set.

Quite an easy course if you have done calculus in high school. The ending sections dealing with $T$ may be a challenge , but there is not much about it. Also, epsilon delta proofs are HARD :(

Definitely not an easy course, especially if you're not used to studying on a daily basis. Lots of $T$ if no prior organic knowledge. Make sure you study well in advance for the midterm/ exam.

used to be a stats related course. now it's just vague bullshit thanks to $T$, a typical SJW vague arts prof. Vague arts is a term coined by our Urban Planning cohort to describe this kind of BS profs: https:// www. urbandictionary. com/ define. php? term= Vague% 20Arts

SOO hard to understand, does not care about you , your education , and definitely not your grade in $T$. Test are difficult, and hard to study for because often the questions will not be similar to those on the practice exams , but instead much harder. ALWAYS favors international students. Lets them always sit together during tests and moves us

She's hilarious. If you get on her" good" side and laugh at her jokes during the beginning, you'll be set for the rest of the semester. $T$ are EASY. You write a rough draft, turn it in, she tells you what to fix, then you get a 100 on the final draft if you do what she says. Would definitely recommend her for an easy A.

Depends on your $T$, mine had no idea what they were doing but at least marked easy. Would mess up experiments and force us to stay later to finish it correctly.

If you take $T$, you're in for a wild ride. Half the class drops the course after the first midterm and for averages midterms are always in the 30s. Course concepts are fairly abstract and fairly hard to practice. Tutorials will save your life. The midterms are 50 minutes and you will fail if you don't have a great understanding of the material. Achieving over a 60 in this course and/ or passing it on your first try is an accomplishment Lol. Extremely useful if you want to pursue inorganic chemistry further. Also group theory sucks.

I improved my $T$ and learned how to properly prepare a formal report. Hence I would not say this course was utterly useless. However, taking this along with CS 251 while on a work term was quite a pain. The work required to do compared to PD 1 was much higher. I felt like some assignments were useless and could be removed to make space for prepping the report instead. I definitely do NOT look forward to the next 3 work reports and PD courses. I feel like PD 1 and PD11 along with one work term report is enough. I doubt I will need this specific report writing skill for my career. For any of you taking this soon, do not be like me and tried too hard for the final report. All you need is a CR so don't waste too much effort.

Very practical , and fun! Classes were competing between groups to solve problems the fastest, with sweet prizes every week. You do need to do $T$ to learn the day's content so that you can compete, but if you do it is a very effective way of learning. After all the practice, you need next to no studying for the final, and you know exactly what will be on in and how you'll be graded. The final is very easy and straightforward, exactly the same as the problems done in class.

This course teaches a completely new $T$ for most, proofs. Once you understand how to build a proof, the course gets easier, however some students never figure that part out. I think the pacing of the course is really well. My biggest piece of advice is to do the assignments by yourself. Struggling through and failing is how you learn. This is what will allow you to figure out exactly what theorems and techniques to use when which is the key to doing well overall. I personally really enjoyed proofs by the end of the course as it is a refreshing way to look at mathematics and if you truly love math you will love this course. That being said, the course is very professor dependent, so different professors provide very different experiences in this course.

Great guy to have as a $T$ Teaches the law and gives you the tools you need to think for yourself- but he doesn't make it easy. You have to work for it, which in the long run is a good thing. Also, if you say stupid things in class he will call you out on it, so think before you talk.

$T$ was a very strange man. I was not sure what he was doing teaching at a college level and I feel like he should have stuck to high school. He never understood that we as a choir have opinions too and that he should try and incorporate them into his lesson.

She is very enthusiastic about teaching chemistry, but sometimes sidetracks the whole class explaining. Although she speaks English there is a bit of a $T$. The course was slow at first but picked up towards the end. All in all she was an average professor.

No regrets taking this as my communication $T$. It's ridiculously bird as long as you don't live under a rock. Discussion posts( worth 40%) are marked for completion and often take less than 5 minutes to do( twice a week) if you are a decent writer and you use technology regularly. Readings are practically optional( I never did most of them) but they are actually somewhat interesting if you choose to do them. Textbook is supposedly mandatory but is completely unnecessary. There are three small reflections( 500 words) and a final big reflection( 1000 words). I managed to do all the reflections in less than 2 hours each. If you run your paper through Grammarly you should have no problem pulling good marks with minimal effort. Easy peasy.

$T$ has been a life-changing professor for my studies at ASU.

By far the worst $T$ I had in my first term. I had a TA who could not speak English very well so that miscommunication lost me marks on some experiments which was annoying. The labs were always rushed and there was a frenzied panic at the end of a session to finish a bogus discussion and conclusion, and there was always something that screwed me out of a couple percentage points for each experiment. The exam was also bad. The vaguest of suggestions to study for the exam was given, namely:" Just study the theory behind the experiments". I did not study for the exam as long as I would have liked to( mostly from sleep deprivation causing me to sleep in later than I should have on exam day), and by some stroke of luck I managed to pass the course with an 80 %, so I am really glad that happened. I thought that I had bombed the final. Overall, I disliked the lab and everyone I spoke to felt the same way. The only saving grace about the lab was that you did not have to spend too much time preparing for each lab during the week.

course

Took this course in Winter 2022 where half of it was online and another half in person. Never went to campus for this course though as all the screencasts and even the weekly office hours are recorded. The marking scheme is 20% BASS, 15% documentary assignment, 40% Final Exam and 25% Midterm. Both the final and midterm were online and open book. A textbook is not required as all the questions are based on the screen casts recorded. The most frustrating part is probably the $T$ as you do not really need to spend 20 minutes working with a group of 5 people to write 1 multiple choice question. This course requires a lot of memorization especially when it comes to dozens of life cycles and focuses on the similarities/ differences within the 3 domains and 5 supergroups. Dr. Pinherio is very passionate about this course. Finished this course with a high 90 but 90 + is possible.

The marking scheme is 20% BASS, 15% documentary assignment, 40% Final Exam and 25% Midterm. Both the final and midterm were online and open book. A textbook is not required as all the questions are based on the screen casts recorded. The most frustrating part is probably the BASS groups as you do not really need to spend 20 minutes working with a group of 5 people to write 1 multiple choice question. This course requires a lot of $T$ especially when it comes to dozens of life cycles and focuses on the similarities/ differences within the 3 domains and 5 supergroups. Dr. Pinherio is very passionate about this course. Finished this course with a high 90 but 90 + is possible.

Even though the $T$ may be somewhat interesting to some people, it's an unbelievably garbage course that has zero use for the SE degree because it's too low level; it's made even worse by the most mind-numbing and incomprehensible video lectures delivered by Pin-Han Ho.

Useless $T$. The professor is ok, but there is no book assigned, and the PP aren't that great for the type of tests/ qzs he has. He puts the assignment solution online so there is no point to learn. I was hopping to learn more SQl, and Tech stuff but i wasted my time. Why all professors care about quantities not qualities.

( I did this virtually because of COVID-19) In a few words, $T$ is an ordeal for a first-year student because it is highly TA-dependent with vague instructions on how to write university-level lab reports. We had to do the labs at home while thinking of and implementing improvements on our own, which is hard and time-consuming. Your improvement would be good or bad, depending on your TA.

$T$ is horrible and nasty. TAs seem to look for every single statement that could possibly be misinterpreted so that they can take off marks. If you mess something up, they take off marks for the same mistake in the same question multiple times. Their explanations for why marks were removed are terrible. It's like they delight in screwing over hapless students because they're angry at the world or something. Or maybe it's personal and they just hate me. As an example, I lost nearly all marks on a long question because the TA had a bone to pick with the way I described a certain situation, so they took off marks for every single instance where I did it. Based on their commentary, they clearly understood what I meant, and there wasn't anything wrong with the actual solution. I also have lost marks for using the definitions described in our course notes without explaining why they are defined that way. If you don't have a passion for being super-god-level pedantic, avoid the fuck out of this course.

One of the heavier courses in 1B Tron. $T$ took a bit of time to understand, DC circuits and analysis was fairly useful then AC was a breeze( after learning DC of course). This course definitely required the most time since there were weekly assignments, labs and the content itself takes a bit of practice to fully comprehend. Extra help sessions, mock midterms and finals were held by our professor( Nassar) and there are many WEEF TAs so any complaints about the course being hard are in my opinion improper since there are so many resources to help you succeed, but you have to go out and reach them. Definitely a useful and enjoyable course, but you have to put in the work.

This course definitely required the most time since there were weekly assignments, labs and the content itself takes a bit of practice to fully comprehend. Extra help sessions, mock midterms and finals were held by our professor( Nassar) and there are many WEEF TAs so any complaints about the course being hard are in my opinion improper since there are so many resources to help you succeed, but you have to go out and reach them. Definitely a useful and enjoyable course, but you have to put in the work.

I had $T$ last semester and it was one of my best classes. He will make you laugh and help you when you need it. He is hard on grading the work. He could be my father but whoa for the age he has the looks. i will take another a class with him next year in the spring.

This $T$ doesn't care if the students learn anything he just wants to get through the material. On the last test he said if you had a 63/100 thats good, so that means majority of the class did not do well. I have never heard a teacher say a 63 out of 100 is good. I wish I could drop the class but I have no other choice.

Most of the time you didn't have to stay for the whole time since half of the experiments didn't actually work and were predictable anyways. The $T$ were really straight forward and if you've taken any other bio lab, then you should have no problem getting at least an 80 on the reports. There's a quiz associated with each experiment but the 5 or 6 questions they choose from are given to you ahead of time so you can go in knowing what the answers are( those quizzes are free marks so take them). The final wasn't too difficult but it's short so make sure you review your labs well( all aspects) that way you can score high.

Honestly not bad. For me, the $T$ actually felt easier than 113, and I feel like this content should have come first, actually. The 40/60 exam split was scary at first, but he makes it very clear which content is going to be covered on the exams, and the questions you do on the exams aren't generally any more challenging then the ones shown in class. The lectures can drag at 2 hours, but to do well in the class, you need to go to all of them. The tutorials are less helpful, but if you felt lost throughout the lecture, they will definitely help. The upside to the 40/60 distribution is that you won't need to spend too much time on this course at all, and if you spend just 2-3 days on the content before the exams, you will do fine.

$T$ is a fantastic prof and I chose this course specifically for him. Don't choose this course expecting it to be easy. For the first few weeks you will be outside collecting inverts for your specimen collection. Then you will have labs every week with lab quizzes. Study the lab material before hand and you will be fine. Midterms / Finals are all written and were fair. He gives you choices of questions to answer so if you don't have time to study all of them you can still get a decent mark. This is not a memorization course. He is testing you on the concepts and compare and contrast. I really enjoyed this course and if you think inverts are interesting I'm sure you will too:) Like all courses you get what you put into it. I will say that it is possible to get over 90 in this course.

$T$ is obviously intelligent, and has a remarkable understanding of the material that he teaches. However he does spend quite a bit of time talking about the famous scientists that he has met, and their accomplishments( as if it makes him more qualified than he already is). He tests on the minutia of each section so read thoroughly& often.

$T$ has been my first english professor here at Waubonsee. Now ENG101 is your standard english class, so naturally the class can get a bit ... dry. However, Laufenberg definitely has a sense of humor, and makes the class laugh all the time. Also, clear guidelines for what you need to do for each essay are always given. Great teacher

I really love the $T$ and am eager to learn more of it. However, this course is laid out in a very poor manner. One prof designed the course and multiple sections are taught by Masters students- encouraged to speak ONLY in German. Right from the first day it was a bit of a nightmare, with the whole class confused and scratching their heads. They try to teach through immersion, but you need first to learn and understand how the German language works with conjugation/ sentence structure before you can just learn by having a teacher ask you a bunch of questions in German. Also, it was VERY confusing and disorganized online with what was due on what day. Exercises due in the exercise book, but then exercises also due in the textbook, then potentially optional-maybe-graded exercises in the cultural reader, and then additional weekly homework projects assigned online- different than the weekly homework assigned by the teachers in class. The labs didn't even practice speaking- just more writing with confusing exercises that we never had time to finish without staying 10-20 mins after class. In contrast, SPAN 101 and 102 is laid out very well- and the online course material is very well put together. I recommend avoiding GER 101.

$T$ is brilliant. He claims there is no extra credit, but doing homework( his answers are online) earns you about 5 % E . C . on each of the exams. He is a great educator and he instills work ethic in most people who don't have it. He grades very fairly. He is very respectful and creates an environment of equality.

$T$ has to be the worst professor I've ever had. He is very condescending and hostile during office hours.

Good $T$, Interesting material. Prof can be a harsh grader, but very responsive and helpful. Readings can be too long so I just skimmed them and read the PP lectures. You need to do 5 journals, a group contract, a talking point( discussion), and a final paper. In addition to weekly participation which accounts for 10% of the grade.

Pretty easy $T$ that you can take even if you skip all the classes( I did because of work and I still managed to get a high grade). So pretty good for Co-Op. Textbook is a must since you need to cite a lot of it for the assignments. Four assignments and that's it: mess even one of them up and your average will take a big hit. But grading policy was quite lenient( got high grades even though I procrastinated a lot and wrote whatever came to mind). Never met the Prof. because much of my learning was asynchronous but everyone says he's one of the best in the field so there's that. Course was kind of useful but also kind of felt like a waste of time. But that could just be me.

$T$ has been reworked as of Fall 2021 so while the past years reviews make this course seem very scary and difficult, it has been reworked and is much more manageable as a technical elective. I did the blended version of this course so the labs( which were online) are likely going to change in person, but the expectations were very reasonable. This course is definitely not a bird course but if you are interested in robotics it is very interesting and useful!

Not a good $T$. Expected the students to already know what he was doing without explaining it. Sometimes funny, but that's not what's important. He gets off topic easily and rarely helps a student when they ask for it one on one in class. He just tells you to look at your book to learn it.

Highllyyyy TA dependent cuz you will never see $T$ lmao. I think I saw him walk in and out of our class like once. Pray for a knowledgable TA because otherwise you're screwed. My TA was clear but a hard marker( which I rather have than vice versa). Try to do the experiment as quickly as possible because graphing and calculating uncertainties for everything will take up the rest of the class. Everyone basically rushed at the end because I don't think enough time is given. However, since I was learning basically nothing in PHYS 111, this course was useful in understanding the overlapping concepts. Idk if this course is curved or what because I calculated my mark to be a 76 but ended with an 82:)

$T$ is one of the most time consuming courses I have taken in Waterloo so far. I generally spent 20-30 hours per assignment, debugging and figuring out solutions to interesting problems. However, I felt that we were given all the resources we needed to figure out the course material, and managed to get a 100% on all the assignments given. The material taught in this course was incredibly interesting, and reveals much of the mysteries behind operating systems that even experienced programmers are often oblivious to. The final grade I received in this course was 87%. For most students, this course will be the first true experience with real low level programming, working at the kernel level. The keys to succeeding in this course are good time management skills, a deep understanding of the C memory model and the O. S. memory models taught in this course, and judicious application of the GDB debugger. I took this course under professor Wong, whom I recommend, although watch out for the midterm if he is lecturing in your offering.

Tips: 1. Do your experiments at a good pace but do it right and make sure you know what you're doing every experiment. A lot of my friends got shitty results/ marks because they rushed their experiments. 2. Titration is key learn how to do it properly. 3. Watch experimental procedure videos before the lab to provide a visual guide for the steps. 4. I like to write out a list of things to complete every lab this keeps me on track. 5. $T$ are AWESOME 6. She'll usually open the lab~ 10 mins early so if you get there early you can start setting up for the lab.( MAKE sure to wash your equipment every lab for best result) 7. Adding onto 6 read the pages in the lab manual detailing how to wash equipment. 8. Keep an eye on your equipment and don't break/ lose them( you don't wanna end up paying for them they are expensive) Final words/ Personal Experience: Heidi scares me but if you follow the above tips you should do fine. Your TAs will be your best friends in this lab get on their good side. Most TAs are really nice so that shouldn't be a problem. Personally I did pretty well in this lab thanks to those tips. Heidi likes to scare you for the first few weeks to make people drop because there's a LONG waiting list for this lab. Shrug her attitude away and focus on your experiment.:) Good luck in the lab!

If you are going into the health sciences, you have to take $T$. If you have to take this class, you should take it with Deeter. He is a very thoughtful, caring professor who will walk you through every assignment. He has a great sense of humor. You have to work your butt off, it's not going to be easy, but it will definately be worth it.

It's a very interesting $T$ because I have never taken one which teachs about business strategy specifically. Although, it's very subjective and the way you describe your answer on the exam matters, but the profs are sometimes lenient in giving you the marks. The exam cases are long and you really need the entire 2 or 3 hrs to do it. Do at least a couple of practice cases before doing the exams, they really help.

This was one of the hardest classes I have taken yet. 50+ pt quiz each week. Big $T$ 150+ pt each. Medical diagrams are hard, she wont tell you which to study. Extra credit is summaries of medical stuff. HW is each week+ due 2 days before class. Friendly and caring but very hard teacher. Class always goes over regular class time extra 20-10mins+

I have major respect for $T$. When he makes a mistake he apologizes& is very fair & genuine. He always makes things right. If you do the assignments, which also are good study tools you will have a good chunk of your grade made. I found the tests to be difficult, but I learned to adjust my study habits& my scores improved. No regrets!

$T$ is a cool guy, but goddamn his grading schemes can be complicated. The textbook is a waste of resources, you dont need it for the whole term b/ c theres no exam, for each project just have your group members use up their free 14 day trial for Mymanagementlab or Pearson or whatever it is. Rent it out of the library too if possible. Never buy a textbook for any SCIBUS course in general. Course material is dry AF and your experience/ ease of the material will solely depend on the quality of your group members and your TA's ability to decipher what they" think" Okey means when it comes to assignment criteria.

$T$ requires your attendance and your complete focus. Professor Mills cover several philosphers over the course of the semester. He is a very good teacher and has a way of making philosphy interesting. You are required to complete essays each week and it counts as 80% of your grade, so do the essays and you will pass the class.

Not very difficult $T$ and final exam was incredibly easy. 90 + easily achievable, but 95 + can be tricky. I was bummed that the final exam did not specifically emphasize the mechanisms but rather throw in irrelevant nit picky questions straight from the slides that test pure memorization rather than learning concepts. Should have made the final exam harder by throwing in the mechanisms because that would have made the exam much more interesting!!!

Very interesting $T$, very math heavy course too! The physics of General Relativity are introduced and taught well. Many of these topics require math not normal covered in the prerequisite chain for this course though. Mathematical concepts( Tensors, Einstein Notation, Differential Geometry, Manifolds) are introduced quickly and you will have to master them on your own. I recommend you take PMATH 365( Differential Geometry) and even PMATH 465( Manifolds) if you want to get a leg up on those topics. At the time of writing, there's no dedicated math course( although Eduardo is pushing to have a Math Phys foundation course), but AMATH 361( Continuum Mechanics) also introduces Tensors+ Einstein Notion in a lighter physics setting with the added bonus of keeping your PDEs skills fresh for GR. If you can get an handle on the math, the physics is really interesting from in-depth Special Relativity, Postulates of GR, Metrics, Einstein Equations, and more!

As an extremely average student, who is not especially good at math, I found $T$ to be both very fun and a bit challenging. Some of the content is hard to understand at first, but as long as you keep grinding out practice problems and spamming questions on Piazza you will be fine! I strongly believe that ANY student that just puts in the time and effort will succeed.

The first half of the course was on China, and the second half was on Japan, Korea, and southeast Asia. The test and assignment questions were focused on history and politics.

$T$ was so poorly organized by TAs and professor. The TAs would dock marks for different things and would never give a straight answer about deliverables. Nobody knows what's going on and check ins + help sessions are so counter productive.

The $T$ is somewhat interesting- it at least opens your mind up to some new paradigms. The emphasis on a really odd code style( outdenting, for(;;), etc.) is a bit unfortunate. It would've been slightly more useful if a practical language was used instead of a pedagogical one( uC++).

The $T$ were interesting but I think they were very outdated. Large portion of the course was spent on traditional AI techniques such as A* search algorithm, constraint satisfaction, and rational reasoning, which aren't very useful. There was little focus on machine learning. The assignments were also not very useful, but they could depend on the the term. It does give an overview of AI so it's worth taking

The $T$ reads like a 1st year course but the midterms were surprisingly hard! Doesn't need as much of a time investment as other 3rd year courses so that's good; doing the readings a few days before the midterms should be okay. Easy to underestimate but also easy to do well in.

I took $T$ for A& P 1 and A& P 2. He is a fantastic professor. He comes in about an hour befor lecture to answer any question you may have. If you are in one of his lab classes he will permit you to attend his other lab class to get extra lab time. Come to class prepared and work for your grade.

Very similar to CHEM 120L. The problem was that $T$ were not in sync, and so we had to do equilibrium problems before we learned them in lecture. Sue does a good job of explaining how to do the problems in the lab manual, but it's a good idea to start them early so you can get help if needed. Lab report marking really depends on how picky your TA is. The experiments done were pretty fun! However the final was not fun because it was very calculation based and felt very long. It was hard because you had to know the methods for a lot of different types of calculations, and having both the CHEM 123 and CHEM 123L exams on the same day didn't help. It definitely brought a lot of marks down.

If you took French up to grade ten, $T$ should be an absolute walk in the park. Most of the things we learned was a natural progression from mid-high school level French, with some review. I actually like this course better than some other 101-level language courses. Also, there's no oral component to the course( so no presentation or video).

I would have liked to see a $T$ similar to MATH 137P& 138P. That being said the course covered exactly as mentioned in the above description( in that order). Assignments and quizzes alternated every week. The quizzes are a bit easier but you have less time and you're more likely to make a mistake. Not too difficult in the end if you go to all the lectures and understand the material. Not many applications, just straight up Calculus.

If you took accounting in high school, you're pretty much set for most of this course.

Although lots of $T$ has been brilliant and I wouldn't trade the friends I have made for anything the academic support is absolutely awful. The staff are unsympathetic, feedback vague and contradictory. I went to my tutor to ask for more detailed feedback or examples of how I could have improved my work and he was unable to go into more detail but considering the mark I was given there must have been a lot there to improve. If you're going to spend £9, 250, spend it on somewhere that actually cares about its students. Exeter only cares about it's reputation and the lecturers are definitely chosen based on their research rather than the quality of their teaching which would be fine but again for the amount of money you would be better off elsewhere.

The $T$ is- in essence- a great way to demonstrate what you learned throughout your undergrad. However, the format of both CIVE400 and this course is terrible. For one, in CIVE400 we were urged not to do a lot of design work and moreso the " qualitative " research part of the project. This is a trick, do as much as you can from the start or you will feel the burn in 401. Your topic and the scope of your topic really have no limitations outside of what you deem is appropriate, and this can be dangerous because no one will tell you if it is too much. For civils, there's not a lot of " innovation " that you'll find yourself doing that will be comparable to the SEs, ECEs, Mech kids and etc. My advice: pick a topic and define a MANAGEABLE amount of work so you don't screw yourself over later. If you're not trying to redefine the entirety of civil engineering and do something simple with your project- you will have a good time. If you're a high flyer and want to design something really insane then I wish you luck: time management and organization are your best friend.

For civils, there's not a lot of " innovation " that you'll find yourself doing that will be comparable to the SEs, ECEs, Mech kids and etc. My advice: pick a topic and define a MANAGEABLE amount of work so you don't screw yourself over later. If you're not trying to redefine the entirety of civil engineering and do something simple with your project- you will have a good time. If you're a high flyer and want to $T$ then I wish you luck: time management and organization are your best friend.

She is the worst $T$ I have ever had. She never actually * taught * anything, but instead let the students attempt the teaching, only to have our hazarded ideas or creative theories received by her trademark ice queen stare... or an occasional," Well, isn't that obvious?" Absolutely useless and should NOT be a teacher.

$T$ requires a lot of memorization but it helps to really know your mechanisms inside out so you can understand how all of the reactions work. Strategy for the synthesis problems are a huge must.

The $T$ had a lot of concepts to cover in the span of the semester. We had 3 exams( 2 midterms, and a final). If you keep up with the content, you should be fine but it is not a bird course, requires quite a bit of effort to understand the content. Took it during a co-op term and the course kept me busy. It was online and the professor went through the content nicely and made notes summarizing important points which were very helpful. I found n older version of the textbook online and I used that and it worked out well. There is also a youtube channel that covers all content thoroughly. Just search the name of the textbook on youtube you should be able to find it, the channel is called FinanceKid.

There are many resources available TAs, course is extremely well organized and book is useful. Level of education I expect from UBC but do not always get. Thank you $T$!

Absolutely one of the best professors I've ever had. In the beginning, hes going to lay down the law. There is NO chewing gum, NO foodwater, and NO lateness. $T$ may come off as mean , BUT don't let that fool you. This man is the best. He tells you what you need to know, he's SUPER FAIR, and he just wants you to learn. Not an easy A but 100 % do-able

I still couldn't tell you what this course is about. The $T$ is genrally relevant , but very random and repetative. In your lecture summaries, make sure to touch on material covered from both lectures and focus on your analysis/ thoughts. Prof ( Qian ) can be a little out of pocket so watch out

Consists of two midterms and a final exam. If you've taken BIOL 110( Zoology), $T$ is the next step up. Lots of content, memorization is necessary. For me, the life cycles were the hardest part of the course, so be sure to review them regularly. I recommend keeping organized charts of the various groups of organisms as you go along, it makes it much easier to study for the tests/ exam. Textbook is useful but not required to do well.

Easiness: Its half credit so the $T$ is much less than any other 1B course. But it's a weird one though, you either get it or don't.

It's a great $T$ to integrate two areas of accounting into one course but considering the time given the organization is horrible, Tax gets curved a lot so there's nothing to worry about. However, in audit, there's no clarity regarding the marking of the integrated audit case, it was difficult to achieve a good mark. Final doesn't get curved a lot and I personally found it harder than the tax exam.

Awesome $T$, very helpful! If you are willing to learn she will go out of her way to make sure you understand everything.( Not sure what the previous poster ment about not being great for females because I never had a problem with her and I know several women that didn't either!)

This is a mandatory course for all undergrad BSc students. It is comprised of 2 $T$ and a final which are all very fair. Often, the first midterm is mainly on high school review and modules 0-1 from the course notes whereas the 2nd midterm is more based on new contents, so modules second half of 1-4. The content itself is pretty easy to understand assuming that you have a great understanding of the concepts taught in grade 12, but if not is also easy to grasp with practice. This class is designed to ensure that students do their best in this course and can be seen through the various questions provided from multiple assignments, online quizzes and clicker questions done throughout the course. BEFORE EACH MIDTERM AND FINAL EXAM: Make sure to do the practice sample midterm / final exam questions provided on Learn as they are very similar ( like 95 %) TO the ones on the midterms. There are also various ways to get help when you do not understand a certain material. The profs for this course also have review sessions before finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice. DISCLAIMER; DO NOT BUY A TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS. I bought just the textbook and not the solutions manual and I did not even open it ONCE. The course notes and the practise questions provided by these profs are enough!!

This $T$ is an approachable and real individual. She is fair in her grading methods, understanding but not to be taken advantage, respectful, and calm & collective. In a nutshell, you will get out of this class whatever you put into it. It is a writing intensive course but she gives you all the materials and guidance you need.

Very sweet and really loves her students. $T$ doesn't speak english well so understanding her is sometimes a problem, but the message always comes through.

The $T$ marked everything and they were super biased. My friend and I would get completely different grades on the weekly responses. Some of the lecturers sucked and were totally boring.

Really easy $T$! I am currently in the 90's. It is really straightforward with weekly assignments that take up to 30 mins to complete. You'll have to write a request, recommendation, and do a crisis communication assignment, all very easy. There is also a final group proposal assignment. The final is literally like doing the assignments all over again consists of a request, recommendation, and bad news letter! It is only worth 25 % as well. A downside to this course is that it heavily depends on your TA. I have friends taking the same course getting lower marks just because of their TA's

This class had AMAZING $T$, lectures, and topics but unfortunately, it has to have been the most disorganized and frustrating class in my whole entire University career so far as a second-year student. To give this course a fair and honest review I will go into it with plenty of depth. Topic-wise I was hooked. I enjoyed learning about protests, criminal law actors, gender, children and youth justice etc, and honestly the lectures were quite relaxed and VERY helpful for the midterm and exams. No lecture slides( which many students disliked)... but I actually found this helpful because the weekly agenda in this course is attending the( 1) lecture and( 2) break out group... then( 3) take notes and you will ace the exams. The breakdown of assignments were okay but I found the marking to be ALL over the place and incohesive. As a strict A or A+ student I was surprised with my low 80 grade on both the written assignment and the oral presentation, and MANY students were appalled with their presentation marks as NO critiques were given yet ended with a low 80. The grades for our Test 1 changed approximately 3 times in the system and it was just all over the place. I am writing this on April 24 and can confidently say this is the ONLY class that I am missing 3/ 6 marks for this late in the term. I have every single solitary mark back( minus exams) in every other course. Students in this class overall have discussed how frustrating and unorganized this is. The professor also makes emailing impossible. Quite literally any small email question will be replied to with" join office hours." The wait for office hours is approx. 30-1. 5 hours. I found this ridiculous and AGAIN the only class I have had so far where emailing was made impossible by the professor. I also know that many students struggled with the fact that lectures were not recorded and if you were sick there was no way other than sharing notes to receive the lecture content( again noting that lecture slides ceased to exist). Overall nice content but extremely disorganized and received lower marks than I was expecting yet this was the easiest LS course I have ever taken. The professor seemed to make this course scary for no reason, stating in lecture 1 that this course would be challenging. This course is NOT challenging and extremely easy and simple yet marking and disorganization made it dreadful!

Overall nice content but extremely disorganized and received lower marks than I was expecting yet this was the easiest LS course I have ever taken. The professor seemed to make this course scary for no reason, stating in lecture 1 that this course would be challenging. This course is NOT challenging and extremely easy and simple yet marking and disorganization made it dreadful!
lectures
Positive
This class had AMAZING content, lectures, and topics but unfortunately, it has to have been the most disorganized and frustrating class in my whole entire University career so far as a second-year student. To give this course a fair and honest review I will go into it with plenty of depth. Topic-wise I was hooked. I enjoyed learning about protests, criminal law actors, gender, children and youth justice etc, and honestly the lectures were quite relaxed and VERY helpful for the midterm and exams. $T$( which many students disliked)... but I actually found this helpful because the weekly agenda in this course is attending the( 1) lecture and( 2) break out group... then( 3) take notes and you will ace the exams. The breakdown of assignments were okay but I found the marking to be ALL over the place and incohesive. As a strict A or A+ student I was surprised with my low 80 grade on both the written assignment and the oral presentation, and MANY students were appalled with their presentation marks as NO critiques were given yet ended with a low 80. The grades for our Test 1 changed approximately 3 times in the system and it was just all over the place. I am writing this on April 24 and can confidently say this is the ONLY class that I am missing 3/ 6 marks for this late in the term. I have every single solitary mark back( minus exams) in every other course. Students in this class overall have discussed how frustrating and unorganized this is. The professor also makes emailing impossible. Quite literally any small email question will be replied to with" join office hours." The wait for office hours is approx. 30-1. 5 hours. I found this ridiculous and AGAIN the only class I have had so far where emailing was made impossible by the professor.

she is an amazing $T$. gives 18 extra points for quizzes from the book. posts powerpoints on blackboard so its not that important to attend class. but gives excellent lectures and if you regularly attend class you'll do good. But if you choose to read from the book only you score around a B. I just 4 absences and got an A+ in her subject.

Winter 2022" online-to-in-person" semester consisted of 10 short quizzes( 5 marked), 6 assignments, and 2 midterm exams( no final exam). Light to moderate $T$.

No physics background is required, but experience in looking at and solving energy equations is very helpful!

$T$ has been by far one of my favorite professors at OU. I would highly recommend this professor to anyone. I always looked forward to going to class because he actually made it enjoyable!

Steve has been by far one of my favorite professors at OU. I would highly recommend this professor to anyone. I always looked forward to going to class because he actually made it enjoyable! There is $T$ every night but it's not graded hard at all! Be sure to take good notes because both the midterm and final are open note and book( yay)!

$T$ is useful for higher level courses math faculty courses such as STAT and CO that require proofs using matrices but is pretty limited in usefulness after that.

I loved $T$!!! Yes she did give only power points that got boring, but she knew her stuff and she gave AWESOME reviews for the test, they were long and detailed, but if you really studied them then you should have had no problem getting an A!!! You need to study for this class, no way around it!!

Had $T$ for lab and he was extremely helpful! He can be a bit grumpy sometimes, but even he blames it on his old age. He is always willing to help during office hours and can be pretty lenient about deadlines if you talk to him. Definitely recommend!

It's quite a straightforward $T$ that unfortunately smashed two useful stats courses together because of the Software Engineering rough schedule. I'm not a fan of it because of that, but I still refer to some of the things I learned from here when I do data-related analyses.

Very birdy $T$, you learn how to communicate in the business world( which is actually quite useless for an engineering major, unless one decides to go work at a bank or finance company). There's a group project at the end which can be annoying and difficult to coordinate since it's a group of 5-6, everyone's on their own schedule( as the course is online..) I did this on a co-op term though, so I wasn't too stressed out.

$T$ are stupid, and have nothing to do with course material. First assignment was a 400 word essay on a news article about fossils.

Took this course online during the Winter 2021 term with Barbara Daly. It was a pretty easy and usually a fun $T$. Learned a lot about Microsoft Word, proper design techniques, photo editing, databases, and a bit about SQL and HTML. I didn't find the course videos that were provided to be particularly useful, and most of the content that you couldn't understand could be searched up on Google. The final unit on FileMaker databases was a bit tricky since most people were not familiar with the program but it was cool to see the final product of a database come to life. Overall, this is a course that I recommend as an elective and the difficulty depends on whether or not you have some prior experience with the course content.

I get why a course with this title needs to exist in the program, but the $T$ is not fun and is deeply problematic( despite ongoing efforts to revamp the course) for reasons that were already mentioned in other reviews, so I won't repeat them. If your FYDP does not have a significant UI component& a good meaty variety of use-cases, make up something else for the project and let your TA know. The weekly deliverables will wear you down; at least make sure to set expectations with your team and spend time splitting up sections in a reasonable way. A midterm would have been useful in this course to take some of the memorization burden off the final. Ultimately just get through the course and celebrate being done the SE463 / 4 / 5 sequence when it's over!

Rabbi Geoffrey Dennis is an awesome teacher. He is kinda all over the place with the class discussions, but they are always related to the subject and are always interesting. I have taken four of his classes. He does a great $T$ where he basically makes an outline for you. Very understanding and an extremely intelligent man!

I had $T$ for Psychology of Leadership& Operations Mgmt. She is a very fair and clear. She can relate the topic to you in everyday realistic terms. She asks that you write a weekly paragraph about what is going on in the world around you. She gives a review sheet so you will know exactly what to study. I got A's in both of her classes.

This $T$ is a brief introduction to Hydraulics and calculating properties throughout a circuit. Calculations wise it's a combination of Fluids 1 content( pipe losses, flow) and control systems( natural frequency springs etc.) They cover a bit of PLC's at the end but nothing too complex. The marking was very fair and reflected lecture content and there are a lot of labs and assignments to boost marks as long as you put the time into them.

An excellent $T$. The first third of the course was a review of high school probability( sample spaces, permutations, combinations, etc.). In contrast, the second half introduced some new concepts such as different distributions( poison, exponential, etc.), expected value/ variance, and multivariate distributions. The hardest part was definitely the last 2 chapters( multivariate distributions/ moment generating functions) as not a lot of time was spent on those sections, but the rest was well paced. For spring 2022, the course was 15% quizzes( best 3/ 6 taken), 25% for the best midterm, 10% for the worst midterm, and 50% for the final. All of the tests / quizzes were fair. All in all, an excellently executed course.

Pre-midterm is almost common sense / high school review, post-midterm it actually starts getting interesting but much more difficult- don't fall behind. Took this course online with $T$- he's a great guy and a great prof, really cares about his students.

VERY helpful and thorough- I've never made a lesson or unit plan before, and by the end of the class I was a whiz. Although $T$ aren't realistic for beginning teachers, it does give us a goal to work toward. He used to teach in high schools and his other job is helping at-risk schools- he knows his stuff! Recommended highly!

I strongly agree that $T$ is not well-designed. I guess the professor who comes up with the idea to let the students ranked by classmates instead of exams hates nerds. I learned nothing in this course. Furthermore, I guess the professors don't realize that peer rankings are influenced by many aspects except the student's performance. Maybe they noticed that, and they just don't care.

The $T$ is really , really cool if you're interested in the cellular functions that go on in the brain. The lab was quite cool, and teaches a lot of the underlying concepts that will be covered. The examination is based on analysis of figures from the textbook- you will want it for this class. Don't buy the courseware if you don't mind filling out a PDF instead of writing on paper. You'll need to, as he says, understand the relationships between the various variables that are manipulated. While not difficult, some people might be turned off by the physics involved in the course.

Easy-ish $T$ if you put the effort in. 3 midterms( consisted of MC, T/ F, and Calculations), 3 assignments( take the 2 highest), and about 10-ish quizzes( Infinite attempts to get marks), plus clickers( and bonus clickers which is a total mark booster). If you have Metzger make sure to do the homework because it really gets it into your head for practice.

Of all the online classes I've taken so far, this one is probably the best. $T$ seems to have been adapted very well to the online learning platform, since most of the content was very well organized on LEARN. Sue Stathopulos is amazing, I've had a great TA so far. The lab test was the only thing that brought my mark down but only because I didn't study very well for it. I would just recommend studying for the lab tests thoroughly and to avoid finishing the pre lab assignments the day of. Overall, probably my favourite course so far!

I might be in the minority, but I loved $T$. It was structured well, gave a good introduction to R, and presented a lot of useful and relevant information in almost every module. There were five quizzes approximately every other week( untimed, 3 attempts, 48-hour window), two R assignments instead of a midterm( which I found to be quite nice), and a 3 hour timed final( which was pretty alright). Make sure to actually try attempting some of the exercises in R( as suggested) in the start of the course, it'll definitely help with the quizzes and assignments. Professor Chause was also pretty nice and always replied quickly to questions from students.

Expecting this to be a cornerstone of the SE program, I was extremely disappointed by $T$. Poorly structured and laid-out as well as scheduled. No body wants to come to an 8 : 30 class when they have 5 classes the same day. Also disliked the wiki approach used to communicate marking schemes/ deadlines/ proposal statuses. Appreciate the flexible deadlines, but in turn this makes it difficult to understand what is expected.

I passed, but I will never take another drawing class as UCF.. will make you hate drawing.

$T$ is hands down the most professional, most caring, and overall best professor for any class I have ever had. Calculus has proven to be an intensely difficult course, but he makes it manageable. he gives out note packets that you do, in full, in class and the tests are exactly like to them, and the optional homework.

$T$ was amazing. For the first time, there's no worrying about your lab partner: it's just you and the chemicals. When I took this course, it was just 4 long experiments and you organize your time accordingly throughout the semester: for students taking it in Fall 2016, you now have 7+ experiments, so I'm not sure how much the formatting's changed. It's a lot of work, but it's incredibly rewarding. I loved it.

It's a class. The $T$ is quite mundane, especially towards the end of the semester. There are numerous " required " ways to read weekly material, audio, textbook and lecture notes, and it just feels like way too much content when pages are filled from top to bottom with words. The assignments are straightforward, but very easy to not do well on given that you don't really get practice on how to do anything asked in them. Still not a bad class, just not as interesting as it seemed.
