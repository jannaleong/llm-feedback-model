Not a hard course if you go to class and listen to the prof( Bill Bishop). Too many $T$ to cram, but they are a strong resource, especially if you annotate them during lectures. Plenty of past midterms and exams but don't expect a really high mark just from those. A lot of content that can be dry at times, but overall an enjoyable course. Labs are very long and can go wrong just about anywhere if not set up properly so get help from the TA's while you can.

The most useless $T$ I've ever taken. The standards for the assignments are ridiculously low. You'd think in a design class, you'd learn how to design / plan / implement projects were economically or, at very least, physically feasible, but that really wasn't the case. Many of the groups that retrieved high marks had issues with hindering their entire designs on technologies that did not yet exist, were clearly economically unfeasible, or didn't really solve the problem they were tasked to solve. The first two out of three major projects were designing a poster and re-design of a room/ space. The course really wasn't challenging, didn't introduce any novel material about design or design strategies, and no real concern seemed to go towards the viability of designs / solutions.

Arrogant , inconsiderate , and unreasonable. For a professor teaching argumentation, $T$ employs textbook fallacies against his own students. Assignment expectations are vague and understated, marks aggressively like he has a personal vendetta with his students, and will not , under any circumstance , yield to alternative justified reasoning. Everything besides his opinions is wrong and irrelevant in his eyes. For any student taking this course outside of their major as an elective, your intelligence will be shamed and disregarded in favor of the subjective flavor of" common sense" the professor employs. A near unwavering offline class consensus was reached on the disapproval of this professor. However, the course itself is somewhat useful in all real-life forms of communication, so I recommend it but stay away from this prof.

$T$ pretty easy, then ramped up right around midterm season and then by the end it was getting pretty theoretical. If you don't know something, ask, because there's a really good chance that the small details you don't understand will come up later on, especially when you start getting into the parts of making your own assembler, compiler, and things in Racket. Speaking of which, this course made me appreciate Racket more:)

The $T$ are the * bare minimum * you need to take this course. The material regularly involves upper-year optimization / statistics content which is only covered in 1 or 2 review lectures at the beginning. With Yaoliang, the material was very theoretical and mathematical, and I only understood 50 % of the content--- enough to have an intuitive understanding of the concepts, but not enough to really understand all of the proofs presented in the lectures. Fortunately, this was enough to get a grade of 90+. For the students who want to go further and gain a deeper understanding, the professor was very helpful in answering questions and providing pointers/ resources on Piazza.

Teaching proof techniques is the main focus of the course, and is done quite well-- but all the topics that we touched on( gcd, complex numbers, modular arithmetic), were interesting too! One assignment a week, which usually took 3-6 hours, plus three Mobius quizzes a week, open for 24 hours each. The midterm was challenging but still fair, and the final was much easier. My only regret is not taking MATH 145 instead. If you are anywhere near the Euclid score cutoff, you should apply for the advanced courses instead-- you will likely find 135 to be fairly easy.

$T$ is interesting and quite in depth. Basically split between linear regression and time series. Not a easy course. If this is the first stats course you took( stat230/231 are not really real stats courses), then you will need to get used to how its not super structured like before where you have lots of samples to study from and really dig into the material. I found this to be exponentially harder than 230/231 and require some concepts of 235/237 which should be prerequisites really.

may I start from the fact that this is one Handsome $T$. If that doesn't motivate you enough to be on your best behaviour in class and work hard, here's more.

One of the most tedious classes I've ever taken, I've learned nothing about auditing. He tries to make accounting philosophical, which it clearly is not.

Easiest $T$ I've ever taken in my life( including high school). I did take band through grade 9-12 in high school though, so I did have a little background information which helped a bit for the first quiz.

Because of covid, we had around 5 days- 1 week to finish all the quizzes and tests and exam so it was very doable. Breakdown: listening quiz( 15%), midterm test( 25%), 2 concert reviews( each 10%), final exam( 40%). Concert reviews are participation, just hit all the points and you get 100%. I finished the course with a 98. I definitely recommend it if you have even the tiniest interest in" classical music". It was enjoyable and easy.

Constructive criticism can be very helpful in a legal writing course. However, don't expect to get any of that in $T$. She is spiteful , rude , and condescending. She goes out of her way to intentionally confuse and mislead her students. Her lectures are absolutely worthless; she uses them as an opportunity to hear herself speak.

$T$ is a great prof. That is assuming you can handle and are not offended by his obvious and never ending sexual innuendo throughout the course. That is also assuming you are a female thus having no problem with 75 % of the course being based on the " female experience " and how terrible the male gender is. Other than that he marks hard as well.

$T$ is a very smart , intellectual man who has clearly had a lot of experience within the business world.

I don't know how this course has such a high useful rating. It was the most useless $T$ I've ever taken. I went to only one lecture and I am still sad that I lost 50 minutes of my life on that. The assignments are not illuminating in the slightest, and are only worth doing because they're 40 % of your grade.

Read syllabus, watch videos, and read his documents of what he requires of you. $T$ will tell you how to get a good grade. It's not hard! I didn't read one chapter, just reviewed the titles of the paragraphs and used the index to answer test questions. Tests are 10 questions with 20 min time limit. Exams are a bit tricky.

The $T$ knows his stuff. That doesn't mean he should teach. I don't deny his genius, but I am not fond of his methods. The rehearsal room is supposed to be a safe place. I felt it to be a courtroom. Listen to him, but don't let him kill your spirit or love of acting. I learned that the hard way. There are amazing directors out there that do support

He is my favorite $T$! He really knows the material and knows how to deliver it well for students to understand. He cares about his students and does not give a lot of homework at all. He gives long PowerPoint lectures but he keeps you interested. Definitely recommend to take him!

The $T$ for the course is pretty interesting. You get to learn about a lot of different data structures and algorithms. The assignments are pretty easy to get high marks on, but the midterm and final are pretty tough. You should definitely attend lectures for this class because some of the data structures / algorithms are way easier to understand in lectures than from just the slides. Compared to either, the course notes are terrible for learning the material, they are written like Calc course notes( very mathematical and hard to understand from reading).

Really good $T$ if you're at all interested in agriculture/ our food system and how it works. The textbook readings are often a quite a few chapters each week, but interesting textbook overall, just skim it to be prepared for lecture. Course is weighted quite heavily though- 25% midterm, 25% assignment and 40% final, so you need to know your stuff for the tests. Most of the content you need is on the slides, so take good notes and pay attention to the documentaries, because they are tested as well.

Broad range of $T$ to being, but quickly narrows down. The concepts and the understanding is fairly easy if you pay attention and go to class( or watch the lecture videos). Can be very " mathy " but there are many tips in tricks to figure out if your struggle with math. An 100 % is very attainable.

$T$ is very demanding but rightfully so-- she puts a lot of effort into her teaching and expects just as much back. She is a very strict , but reasonable grader. Don't try to BS your way through an essay or exam because she'll spot it a mile away. Awesome professor-- much learned-- I feel very disciplined and stronger.

DO NOT TAKE $T$! I repeat, DO NOT take Ovanessian. She is rude and acts like she doesn't want to be there. She gives WAY too much work and moves at an incredibly fast pace for the level we are at. She is hard to understand, and does NOT explain things clearly at all. The class has a very frustrating vibe. She acts like a drill instructor.

I'm not sure what constitutes a good $T$, but she does make you get up in front of the class and give five or six speeches over the course of the semester. This allows you to get more comfortable with being in the spotlight and talking, which really helped my public speaking skills( and hopefully your's as well).

He's extremely engaging and knowledgeable about the world of art history. $T$ knows so much info it's impossible not to learn something if you go. Attendance isn't completely mandatory but he does keep track. Tests are super hard but if you go and study you be able to pull at least a B or C. He's also kind of goofy.

I can tell you with certainty that watching paint dry would be more interesting than attending a lecture by $T$. He is an awkward man who is probably a genius but has no communication skills. His bias shines through when he marks papers- and he takes attendance so you have no option but to go and be bored to death. AVOID.

One of the best $T$ I've taken in the C& O department. It's structured in a non-traditional way; there are no weekly lectures, rather there are full course notes and links to Martin Pei's videos. The professor states exactly which pieces of content are relevant for the current week's assignment. It was clear to me that the professor cared more about students actually learning the course content instead of attempting to maintain some arbitrary class average through insanely difficult and time-consuming assessments. The course requires mild , but consistent effort. The assignments were enjoyable and well-designed; the purpose seemed to be to really push us to dig into the proofs in the course notes, reinforce the topics, and build some intuition. If you've taken any other C& O course with a difficult professor, these assignments will seem much easier, mostly because the others are overtuned. The notation in the course notes was mildly annoying to parse through at times, but it was serviceable nonetheless. Heavily dependent on the professor; Martin Pei's course is structured entirely differently with much more difficult assessments. Also, Joseph Cheriyan gives very thorough and helpful Piazza responses, the most I've ever seen. Granted, he is very strict regarding Piazza posting etiquettes( namely, private posts).

This course was very interesting and useful for Rec students. Some of the marking was a little weird because of the $T$, but if you ask about your mark and have a good reason for wanting it raised then it usually is boosted a bit. I liked the external components like the retreat and the program implementation at the YMCA

Absolutely fabulous. $T$ is the best prof I've had this semester. She's engaging and extremely knowledgeable. Her material is interesting and goes way beyond information you may have picked up along the way. Her exams are fair and the topic for the paper was really unique. I'll look for her in the future!

This was a continuation of high school physics with rotational motion, torque, and static equilibrium tossed into the mix. The $T$ were not too difficult to grasp and it was for the most part really interesting. The course consisted of a weekly quiz( which consisted of three questions) on the material covered that week. Thanks to my high school physics background, I could ace all the quizzes without doing the practice questions beforehand. Also were the weekly tutorials. Here you had to write a summary of last week's lectures and do problems with a group. These are optional and I only attended a few but I recommend going to each so that way you get weight shifted off from your final to participation marks. There was one midterm and it was not too bad. I did not study at all for the midterm and still made it out with a decent mark( 79%). The final had some questions that were straightforward but it also had some questions which were pretty brutal, I do not doubt that they curved the grades a bit. Overall it was an interesting course, but I recommend doing the practice problems weekly because cramming for the final was not fun.

Best $T$ I've taken at UW. You learn a ton of useful material, and it's extremely well laid out. Assignments are difficult but if you start them early it's fine.

$T$ is horrible! She has a very thick accent which makes her impossible to understand, her tests / quizzes are hard, she doesn't teach the material, just simply restates what's in the book. I'm basically teaching myself the material. Avoid at all costs.

Took both SPA 101 and 102 with $T$, and would have continued if he'd had higher courses! Class style is straightforward and pleasantly predictable. Prof is helpful and very fair, and uses a lot of different fun activities( loved the cultural presentations!). Pro-tip: do the homework, not for the grade, but because the skills build up quickly.

Very interesting $T$, although unfortunately the last few parts were a bit rushed. The lectures were clear and well made, and the recommended McIntyre textbook is alright too. I appreciate starting with Hilbert spaces and bra-ket notation rather than diving right into wave functions. The assignments and evaluations were very difficult and time consuming and could be pretty difficult though. I found that the best way to prepare for the midterm and final was to just grind out practice problem after practice problem, as it also helped understand the material conceptually. The class was also a bit disorganized in the sense that there seemed to be a disconnect between the TAs and the prof, where at multiple times throughout the course, either during tutorials or while grading assignments, TAs would misjudge what had been covered in the class. Additionally, students who have taken MATH 235 are at an advantage in the sense that a lot of the linear algebra concepts needed such as Hermitian operators is only covered, but this could probably be fixed by taking the first week to review/ introduce these. Overall however, I enjoyed the course.

I appreciate starting with Hilbert spaces and bra-ket notation rather than diving right into wave functions. The assignments and evaluations were very difficult and time consuming and could be pretty difficult though. I found that the best way to prepare for the midterm and final was to just grind out practice problem after practice problem, as it also helped understand the material conceptually. The class was also a bit disorganized in the sense that there seemed to be a disconnect between the TAs and the prof, where at multiple times throughout the course, either during tutorials or while grading assignments, TAs would misjudge what had been covered in the class. Additionally, students who have taken MATH 235 are at an advantage in the sense that a lot of the linear algebra concepts needed such as Hermitian operators is only covered, but this could probably be fixed by taking the first week to review/ introduce these. Overall however, I enjoyed the course.

CHEM 120 is a course that basically all science students have to take. There are 2 midterms and a final. The first midterm is about stoichiometry, which is essentially a lot of calculations and formulas. The 2nd midterm is more theory based and is about things like Lewis structures and periodic trends. The $T$ were both also out of very little( 1st was out of 12, 2nd was out of 16 or 18 iirc), so it can be a little annoying but they were both VERY fair. The content itself can be a little hard to grasp at time, but with practice you will understand. There's also a ton of practice problems available in the course notes and online assignments. Make sure to do the practice problems( especially the ones in the sample midterm) and really understand them because they are often times VERY similar to the ones found on the midterms. The profs for this course will often do review sessions before the midterms and finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice. There is also quite a bit of grade 12 review. If you're thinking about being a keener and buying the textbook, DON'T! Save yourself the money and buy something else!!!! I bought it and barely opened it because we already had so many practice problems available to us. The course notes are basically all you need, and if you have Prof. Sciani, his powerpoint notes are very good too.

$T$ is extremely unorganized and clearly doesn't seem to know how to even use the LEARN system properly. She doesn't post slides for students to follow on LEARN( which is fine normally), but also doesn't post marks to learn , send messages through LEARN. She is clearly technologically incompetent, and doesn't seem to care much about her students ' concerns as she seems rude and unapproachable both in person and through email. It's ironic that this is cross listed with an environment course, yet she wastes so much paper by making sure that everything is done through hardcopy, and even scans and prints copies of scantrons in order to distribute marks. Absolutely ridiculous and a joke of a class.

He's a pretty cool guy , very funny actually. $T$ has a very dark humor and is very cynical. he hates everything especially religion, he talks about sex a lot, so if your easily offended then i wouldn't recommend him. if you dont follow his rules you will have a terrible time in this class. he doesn't give too much homework, and his tests are easy.

Professor Murphy isn't teaching at Vaughn anymore, but I did take $T$ during my first semester in Jan. 2009. It was a memorable class, and Prof. Murphy always challenged his students with fun exercises , papers , and discussions.

Did not like $T$ at all. She's extremely unorganized, rude, grades based on her own opinions. She talks your ear off and says the same things over and over again. Does not explain assignments well and you kind of just have to wing it. She also is constantly marketing her business to her students. Very outdated ideals. Would NOT recommend.

Stupidly easy $T$. Never went and got a mark in the 90s. His lectures are straight out the readings. The tutorials however are nonsense. The mandatory attendance is a garbage rule, if you lose marks for not going that's one thing, but failing the whole component if you miss 2 is absurd. If you get a good TA though it's not terrible, mine let us skip the dumb assignments which was helpful, though I know some TAs made their class stay the whole 90 minutes even if there was nothing left to do.

The $T$ could sometimes be rather extensive, but the book was easy to read and enjoyable. You should probably go to class as he posts the notes, but they are not complete.

$T$ is review from High School. The content should almost be the same as AP Calculus BC. The assignment questions are parodies of what are found in the video lectures, and are not very challenging.

Like most micro courses, if you like the content you'll do well and find it easy , if not , goodluck. The $T$ is not bad though, the dreakdown consisted of a midterm, a partnered term paper an assignment and a final. The midterm was very straightforward( especially since there wasn't tons of content). The paper and assignments were very easy to do well on( 80+); she'll tell you you can't get a good grade leaving them to the last minute but I did both the day before they were due and got 100 on them so don't stress. The final was very fair of the content covered; unfortunately, Barb was replaced halfway through the term by a M . Chaudet who was not the greatest prof in the world. She practically read from the slides without useful elaboration and wasted time trying to encourage students to participate in group discussions rather than getting through the material so we could cover the last ad most interesting topic of the course.

He is tough in that he expects you to put in work. But he also teaches clearly, and he gives extra credit galore. He is funny and personable. Once you get to know him, you'll look forward to sitting in $T$, studying about integrating your hundredth trig polynomial. I didn't even know much of Trig when I first took this. Great professor.

$T$ made art approachable for nearly any student because he isn't trying to make the class hard and confusing.

This was by far my favourite $T$ to date! The content is very interesting, particularly for those with an interest in exploring the microbial world. The content is relatively straightforward, particularly if you've taken cell biology or genetics prior to this course. The mid-term exam and the final exam were both very fair! The content came directly from the slides and from the profs lecture, just be sure to take detailed notes. The textbook( I read each chapter) was helpful, but did not really give any advantage on the exams. Finally, Dr Neufeld is an amazing professor! He is so engaging and is truly passionate about his field. I highly recommend taking the course with him.

horrible $T$ she hardly responds to your emails and is very unclear and critical, she grades unfair don't waist your time but after taking it I felt very discourage she only grades two unanimous chapter analysis, introduction and quizzes the rest of the assignments don't count so the rest of your hard work and time don't count.

" WTF, man I just wanted to learn how to program video games..."- CS365 commenter, 2012
I liked $T$, especially how Scott handled the remote version of this course very well. He got rid of the midterms and did 15 quizzes throughout the term worth 4% each. There were also 4 written assignments, with 10% each. However, I feel as though how well you do on these assignments are dependent on your TA. My TA was very unreasonably strict, and there seems to be no consistency between the marking schemes. If anything, just be wary of that when handing in assignments.

Without a doubt the worst $T$ I've taken at UW in the 7 school terms so far. The contents are completely useless. This is the only course for which learning the materials seems to serve no other purpose than to pass it so that you don't have to deal with it anymore. The assignments can be a lot of grueling work, and the worst part is they do not help you learn anything remotely interesting or useful. Again, the course is completely useless. Recently they changed the course so that you have to base the course project on your FYDP. The problem is that the course materials often don't apply to your FYDP. If you're making a website or a mobile app, you'll probably be fine; but if you are doing anything else( anything unconventional or a little bit creative), it could get pretty absurd and require you to bend over backwards to fit your project into the boxes defined in the course materials. Half way through the term my group changed our project for FYDP, but had to continue making stuff up based on our old project since all the deliverables are based on previous ones. 0/10 would not recommend. Brace yourselves for the suffering.

$T$ is really helpful to build the conception of abstract algebra and I found it interesting. The assignments are not so hard for a second year student but still not easy to get really high. If you just want to get a pmath minor, then don't take this course in a heavy load term because in that case you would not have enough time to absorb the fun parts inside those proofs.

ACTSC 372 Spring 2020 was offered online due to the pandemic. It started out with option pricing models, then NPVs, then CAPM, capital budgeting, and finally capital structure and market efficiency. This $T$ might seem a little all over the place but it is in fact well-suited for someone who is looking for a way into the financial industry. The real world is messy anyways. Recorded lectures were posted each week with the prof doing derivations on a powerpoint slide deck, which is typical ACTSC courses. I selected" did not like" because being a math student at heart, I find the calculations of NPVs and options prices tedious... this in no way means that the course isn't useful. It's still worthwhile. Assessment was bsaed on three take-home assignments and three take-home tests( tests have a deadline of 24 hours after being available). Tests were very long and arduous, but assignments were okay.

Definitely a necessary $T$ for setting the basics for future courses, but content was extremely dense, and much of the course came down to rote memorization( such as very specific reaction pathways). By the way, the course is essentially a copy and paste of CHEM 266, including labs + lecture order, so you can study with friends from ChemE or sciences.

Everything from lectures is straight out of the textbook with Arshi, so as long as you read the textbook and follow her test outlines you don't really need to go to the $T$.

I actually liked $T$ a lot, but it probably has more to do with the prof than the content itself. Prof. Gibson chose really great readings, and I enjoyed getting to peer edit work in class.

It's unfortunate when $T$. Treats the workload as if she is the only class. If you work full time , forget it. Gives a list of curriculum rather than making an actual test review. Posts material late online. She may not be aware she is teaching adults rather than children.

Hey fellow college friend, warning if you want a terrible English teacher than $T$ is the one you want, she is by far the worst English teacher i've ever had, she makes you redo your paper if you get below a C which with her grading you probably will get, she is by far the most boring person i have ever met, please do not take, you're welcome

Not sure if the $T$ was severely dumbed down from previous terms but it was very easy and fair. I previously took and dropped Phys 131L which was WAY harder than this course. I usually walked into the lab without having even looked at the day's experiment and finished with time to spare. For the final, you don't have to memorize the slopes of the graphs if you understand the theory behind them but there's no formula sheet so you will need to remember those.

Well, he will pull questions from those and expect you to know things you can't possible know. He doesn't hit on any key points in lecture; $T$ just powers through 100 slides each class.

$T$ presents the material well, but he does not give a lot of examples unless you ask him to. He is very willing to help if you need it. We had 2 exams and a group research project as our only grads. I highly recommend.

Not a fan of $T$, but don't blame Racket if you do bad. I ended up with 74%, which for a CS major is not really good and I blamed Racket. Racket is possibly one of the best languages for learning recursion so enjoy this course. Extremely useful course, but was difficult for me.

This was my favorite $T$ of 2A Biochem. Although the course is not always straightforward, and it definitely is not easy, it is the only biology course thus far that have asked us to apply our learning. Not just regurgitate knowledge. It has been the most useful course for obtaining co-op positions, and I felt that it's been super useful in future courses. Go to class!! Don't buy the textbook!

Great $T$ for introductory of Analysis. Watch out first years that this is not" AP Calculus" but" Analysis" so unless you want pure math of MF, I do not recommend this course because you can spend you time more effectively on other stuff. Unless you are sure of your ability( Euclid 90 + or IMO medalist), tread lightly.( preview analysis, cardinality, topology)

Like many other labs, this one is highly TA dependent. I always got 95+ on the lab reports but keep in mind that they do adjust the marks higher or lower depending on the course average. Everyone says that the $T$ is hard but I didn't find it so because as long as you read over the lab manual, watch the technique vids on LEARN and know HOW to do the calculations you did in your lab, you're pr much set.

Surprisingly gentle at the start, I thought I'd be screwed for not taking circuits in highschool. $T$ starts to ramp up after midterm once capacitors/ inductors and AC are introduced, however, the difficulty is manageable if you're diligent about doing the ungraded assignments. Midterm / Final difficulty are fair but no pushover, study well, you'll be fine.

I guess it's a good $T$. Basic grade 12 biology you'd learn. Not much else to it. A little disappointed because it was just a big overview of a normal biology course you'd have in high school.

$T$ is a research-based class, so it's not super easy. You have to write one really big research paper, but he breaks it up and makes you start it so that you aren't procrastinating too much. He can get a little boring in class, but he at least has personality. Honors version is take-home tests.

$T$ has mastered the art of the lecture. Read the slides on your own, it's incredibly dry. When you go to lectures, you magically understand everything.

Introductory $T$ to coding, what more can I say? Very easy if you did any programming course in high school or a boot camp online. Otherwise, it's a good course to learn the basics, though it can move a bit quickly. Stay on top of lectures and don't do the assignments last minute unless you're 100% confident in your coding skill.

If you liked GER 101 you gonna like $T$ too. The material is a bit harder and you have to spend a lot of time on this course but I still enjoyed it. Easy to do good if you put an effort. But the wikipedia project was kinda annoying, you have to write in pairs an article in german. It's doable but I don't think that it's useful for the elementary course. I had to google almost every word in order to write this article.

The $T$ take brutally long and was one of the main reasons I struggled to keep up in my other courses this term. However, the assignments are interesting and build upon one another, so you definitely want to aim for perfect on all of them. You can achieve this relatively easily( time consuming , but not too hard). The content is interesting though not necessarily applicable to your work terms. The exams for our term were relatively fair( thought I have some complaints). Overall an 80 + is rather easily achievable if you do the assignments well and really understand the material. I would recommend doing tutorial assignments.

Took $T$ Winter 2022 where half of it was online and in-person. Dr. Woody uploaded all his lectures and audio recordings online, so I managed to get a high 90 in the course without ever coming to class. A textbook is not needed at all. The marking scheme was 20% Mobius assignments( 10 out of 11), 20% written assignments( 10 out of 11) that were group work, 20% midterms( 2 x 10%), 20% project( group work) and 20% final exam.

Although at times the course did lag as we did nothing but confidence interval calculations for weeks at times, but still it is definitely possible to get 90 +.

$T$ is awesome. Math can be dreadful, but this professor explains things so thoroughly, he makes math a walk in the park. I personally hate math, but this professor made it easy for me. If I can pass his class, anyone can.

$T$ are a lot of fun. They are structured in an informal , social manner. Your comprehension and speaking abilities will improve drastically just by being there and participating. He offers clear , often hilarious , explanations of the grammar or any other question you have. If you put in any effort at all and do the homework, you're set.

Quite an easy course if you have done calculus in high school. The ending sections dealing with $T$ may be a challenge , but there is not much about it. Also, epsilon delta proofs are HARD :(

Definitely not an easy course, especially if you're not used to studying on a daily basis. Lots of $T$ if no prior organic knowledge. Make sure you study well in advance for the midterm/ exam.

used to be a stats related course. now it's just vague bullshit thanks to $T$, a typical SJW vague arts prof. Vague arts is a term coined by our Urban Planning cohort to describe this kind of BS profs: https:// www. urbandictionary. com/ define. php? term= Vague% 20Arts

SOO hard to understand, does not care about you , your education , and definitely not your grade in $T$. Test are difficult, and hard to study for because often the questions will not be similar to those on the practice exams , but instead much harder. ALWAYS favors international students. Lets them always sit together during tests and moves us

She's hilarious. If you get on her" good" side and laugh at her jokes during the beginning, you'll be set for the rest of the semester. $T$ are EASY. You write a rough draft, turn it in, she tells you what to fix, then you get a 100 on the final draft if you do what she says. Would definitely recommend her for an easy A.

Depends on your $T$, mine had no idea what they were doing but at least marked easy. Would mess up experiments and force us to stay later to finish it correctly.

If you take $T$, you're in for a wild ride. Half the class drops the course after the first midterm and for averages midterms are always in the 30s. Course concepts are fairly abstract and fairly hard to practice. Tutorials will save your life. The midterms are 50 minutes and you will fail if you don't have a great understanding of the material. Achieving over a 60 in this course and/ or passing it on your first try is an accomplishment Lol. Extremely useful if you want to pursue inorganic chemistry further. Also group theory sucks.

I improved my $T$ and learned how to properly prepare a formal report. Hence I would not say this course was utterly useless. However, taking this along with CS 251 while on a work term was quite a pain. The work required to do compared to PD 1 was much higher. I felt like some assignments were useless and could be removed to make space for prepping the report instead. I definitely do NOT look forward to the next 3 work reports and PD courses. I feel like PD 1 and PD11 along with one work term report is enough. I doubt I will need this specific report writing skill for my career. For any of you taking this soon, do not be like me and tried too hard for the final report. All you need is a CR so don't waste too much effort.

Very practical , and fun! Classes were competing between groups to solve problems the fastest, with sweet prizes every week. You do need to do $T$ to learn the day's content so that you can compete, but if you do it is a very effective way of learning. After all the practice, you need next to no studying for the final, and you know exactly what will be on in and how you'll be graded. The final is very easy and straightforward, exactly the same as the problems done in class.

This course teaches a completely new $T$ for most, proofs. Once you understand how to build a proof, the course gets easier, however some students never figure that part out. I think the pacing of the course is really well. My biggest piece of advice is to do the assignments by yourself. Struggling through and failing is how you learn. This is what will allow you to figure out exactly what theorems and techniques to use when which is the key to doing well overall. I personally really enjoyed proofs by the end of the course as it is a refreshing way to look at mathematics and if you truly love math you will love this course. That being said, the course is very professor dependent, so different professors provide very different experiences in this course.

Great guy to have as a $T$ Teaches the law and gives you the tools you need to think for yourself- but he doesn't make it easy. You have to work for it, which in the long run is a good thing. Also, if you say stupid things in class he will call you out on it, so think before you talk.

$T$ was a very strange man. I was not sure what he was doing teaching at a college level and I feel like he should have stuck to high school. He never understood that we as a choir have opinions too and that he should try and incorporate them into his lesson.

She is very enthusiastic about teaching chemistry, but sometimes sidetracks the whole class explaining. Although she speaks English there is a bit of a $T$. The course was slow at first but picked up towards the end. All in all she was an average professor.

No regrets taking this as my communication $T$. It's ridiculously bird as long as you don't live under a rock. Discussion posts( worth 40%) are marked for completion and often take less than 5 minutes to do( twice a week) if you are a decent writer and you use technology regularly. Readings are practically optional( I never did most of them) but they are actually somewhat interesting if you choose to do them. Textbook is supposedly mandatory but is completely unnecessary. There are three small reflections( 500 words) and a final big reflection( 1000 words). I managed to do all the reflections in less than 2 hours each. If you run your paper through Grammarly you should have no problem pulling good marks with minimal effort. Easy peasy.

$T$ has been a life-changing professor for my studies at ASU.

By far the worst $T$ I had in my first term. I had a TA who could not speak English very well so that miscommunication lost me marks on some experiments which was annoying. The labs were always rushed and there was a frenzied panic at the end of a session to finish a bogus discussion and conclusion, and there was always something that screwed me out of a couple percentage points for each experiment. The exam was also bad. The vaguest of suggestions to study for the exam was given, namely:" Just study the theory behind the experiments". I did not study for the exam as long as I would have liked to( mostly from sleep deprivation causing me to sleep in later than I should have on exam day), and by some stroke of luck I managed to pass the course with an 80 %, so I am really glad that happened. I thought that I had bombed the final. Overall, I disliked the lab and everyone I spoke to felt the same way. The only saving grace about the lab was that you did not have to spend too much time preparing for each lab during the week.

course

Took this course in Winter 2022 where half of it was online and another half in person. Never went to campus for this course though as all the screencasts and even the weekly office hours are recorded. The marking scheme is 20% BASS, 15% documentary assignment, 40% Final Exam and 25% Midterm. Both the final and midterm were online and open book. A textbook is not required as all the questions are based on the screen casts recorded. The most frustrating part is probably the $T$ as you do not really need to spend 20 minutes working with a group of 5 people to write 1 multiple choice question. This course requires a lot of memorization especially when it comes to dozens of life cycles and focuses on the similarities/ differences within the 3 domains and 5 supergroups. Dr. Pinherio is very passionate about this course. Finished this course with a high 90 but 90 + is possible.

The marking scheme is 20% BASS, 15% documentary assignment, 40% Final Exam and 25% Midterm. Both the final and midterm were online and open book. A textbook is not required as all the questions are based on the screen casts recorded. The most frustrating part is probably the BASS groups as you do not really need to spend 20 minutes working with a group of 5 people to write 1 multiple choice question. This course requires a lot of $T$ especially when it comes to dozens of life cycles and focuses on the similarities/ differences within the 3 domains and 5 supergroups. Dr. Pinherio is very passionate about this course. Finished this course with a high 90 but 90 + is possible.

Even though the $T$ may be somewhat interesting to some people, it's an unbelievably garbage course that has zero use for the SE degree because it's too low level; it's made even worse by the most mind-numbing and incomprehensible video lectures delivered by Pin-Han Ho.

Useless $T$. The professor is ok, but there is no book assigned, and the PP aren't that great for the type of tests/ qzs he has. He puts the assignment solution online so there is no point to learn. I was hopping to learn more SQl, and Tech stuff but i wasted my time. Why all professors care about quantities not qualities.

( I did this virtually because of COVID-19) In a few words, $T$ is an ordeal for a first-year student because it is highly TA-dependent with vague instructions on how to write university-level lab reports. We had to do the labs at home while thinking of and implementing improvements on our own, which is hard and time-consuming. Your improvement would be good or bad, depending on your TA.

$T$ is horrible and nasty. TAs seem to look for every single statement that could possibly be misinterpreted so that they can take off marks. If you mess something up, they take off marks for the same mistake in the same question multiple times. Their explanations for why marks were removed are terrible. It's like they delight in screwing over hapless students because they're angry at the world or something. Or maybe it's personal and they just hate me. As an example, I lost nearly all marks on a long question because the TA had a bone to pick with the way I described a certain situation, so they took off marks for every single instance where I did it. Based on their commentary, they clearly understood what I meant, and there wasn't anything wrong with the actual solution. I also have lost marks for using the definitions described in our course notes without explaining why they are defined that way. If you don't have a passion for being super-god-level pedantic, avoid the fuck out of this course.

One of the heavier courses in 1B Tron. $T$ took a bit of time to understand, DC circuits and analysis was fairly useful then AC was a breeze( after learning DC of course). This course definitely required the most time since there were weekly assignments, labs and the content itself takes a bit of practice to fully comprehend. Extra help sessions, mock midterms and finals were held by our professor( Nassar) and there are many WEEF TAs so any complaints about the course being hard are in my opinion improper since there are so many resources to help you succeed, but you have to go out and reach them. Definitely a useful and enjoyable course, but you have to put in the work.

This course definitely required the most time since there were weekly assignments, labs and the content itself takes a bit of practice to fully comprehend. Extra help sessions, mock midterms and finals were held by our professor( Nassar) and there are many WEEF TAs so any complaints about the course being hard are in my opinion improper since there are so many resources to help you succeed, but you have to go out and reach them. Definitely a useful and enjoyable course, but you have to put in the work.

I had $T$ last semester and it was one of my best classes. He will make you laugh and help you when you need it. He is hard on grading the work. He could be my father but whoa for the age he has the looks. i will take another a class with him next year in the spring.

This $T$ doesn't care if the students learn anything he just wants to get through the material. On the last test he said if you had a 63/100 thats good, so that means majority of the class did not do well. I have never heard a teacher say a 63 out of 100 is good. I wish I could drop the class but I have no other choice.

Most of the time you didn't have to stay for the whole time since half of the experiments didn't actually work and were predictable anyways. The $T$ were really straight forward and if you've taken any other bio lab, then you should have no problem getting at least an 80 on the reports. There's a quiz associated with each experiment but the 5 or 6 questions they choose from are given to you ahead of time so you can go in knowing what the answers are( those quizzes are free marks so take them). The final wasn't too difficult but it's short so make sure you review your labs well( all aspects) that way you can score high.

Honestly not bad. For me, the $T$ actually felt easier than 113, and I feel like this content should have come first, actually. The 40/60 exam split was scary at first, but he makes it very clear which content is going to be covered on the exams, and the questions you do on the exams aren't generally any more challenging then the ones shown in class. The lectures can drag at 2 hours, but to do well in the class, you need to go to all of them. The tutorials are less helpful, but if you felt lost throughout the lecture, they will definitely help. The upside to the 40/60 distribution is that you won't need to spend too much time on this course at all, and if you spend just 2-3 days on the content before the exams, you will do fine.

$T$ is a fantastic prof and I chose this course specifically for him. Don't choose this course expecting it to be easy. For the first few weeks you will be outside collecting inverts for your specimen collection. Then you will have labs every week with lab quizzes. Study the lab material before hand and you will be fine. Midterms / Finals are all written and were fair. He gives you choices of questions to answer so if you don't have time to study all of them you can still get a decent mark. This is not a memorization course. He is testing you on the concepts and compare and contrast. I really enjoyed this course and if you think inverts are interesting I'm sure you will too:) Like all courses you get what you put into it. I will say that it is possible to get over 90 in this course.

$T$ is obviously intelligent, and has a remarkable understanding of the material that he teaches. However he does spend quite a bit of time talking about the famous scientists that he has met, and their accomplishments( as if it makes him more qualified than he already is). He tests on the minutia of each section so read thoroughly& often.

$T$ has been my first english professor here at Waubonsee. Now ENG101 is your standard english class, so naturally the class can get a bit ... dry. However, Laufenberg definitely has a sense of humor, and makes the class laugh all the time. Also, clear guidelines for what you need to do for each essay are always given. Great teacher

I really love the $T$ and am eager to learn more of it. However, this course is laid out in a very poor manner. One prof designed the course and multiple sections are taught by Masters students- encouraged to speak ONLY in German. Right from the first day it was a bit of a nightmare, with the whole class confused and scratching their heads. They try to teach through immersion, but you need first to learn and understand how the German language works with conjugation/ sentence structure before you can just learn by having a teacher ask you a bunch of questions in German. Also, it was VERY confusing and disorganized online with what was due on what day. Exercises due in the exercise book, but then exercises also due in the textbook, then potentially optional-maybe-graded exercises in the cultural reader, and then additional weekly homework projects assigned online- different than the weekly homework assigned by the teachers in class. The labs didn't even practice speaking- just more writing with confusing exercises that we never had time to finish without staying 10-20 mins after class. In contrast, SPAN 101 and 102 is laid out very well- and the online course material is very well put together. I recommend avoiding GER 101.

$T$ is brilliant. He claims there is no extra credit, but doing homework( his answers are online) earns you about 5 % E . C . on each of the exams. He is a great educator and he instills work ethic in most people who don't have it. He grades very fairly. He is very respectful and creates an environment of equality.

$T$ has to be the worst professor I've ever had. He is very condescending and hostile during office hours.

Good $T$, Interesting material. Prof can be a harsh grader, but very responsive and helpful. Readings can be too long so I just skimmed them and read the PP lectures. You need to do 5 journals, a group contract, a talking point( discussion), and a final paper. In addition to weekly participation which accounts for 10% of the grade.

Pretty easy $T$ that you can take even if you skip all the classes( I did because of work and I still managed to get a high grade). So pretty good for Co-Op. Textbook is a must since you need to cite a lot of it for the assignments. Four assignments and that's it: mess even one of them up and your average will take a big hit. But grading policy was quite lenient( got high grades even though I procrastinated a lot and wrote whatever came to mind). Never met the Prof. because much of my learning was asynchronous but everyone says he's one of the best in the field so there's that. Course was kind of useful but also kind of felt like a waste of time. But that could just be me.

$T$ has been reworked as of Fall 2021 so while the past years reviews make this course seem very scary and difficult, it has been reworked and is much more manageable as a technical elective. I did the blended version of this course so the labs( which were online) are likely going to change in person, but the expectations were very reasonable. This course is definitely not a bird course but if you are interested in robotics it is very interesting and useful!

Not a good $T$. Expected the students to already know what he was doing without explaining it. Sometimes funny, but that's not what's important. He gets off topic easily and rarely helps a student when they ask for it one on one in class. He just tells you to look at your book to learn it.

Highllyyyy TA dependent cuz you will never see $T$ lmao. I think I saw him walk in and out of our class like once. Pray for a knowledgable TA because otherwise you're screwed. My TA was clear but a hard marker( which I rather have than vice versa). Try to do the experiment as quickly as possible because graphing and calculating uncertainties for everything will take up the rest of the class. Everyone basically rushed at the end because I don't think enough time is given. However, since I was learning basically nothing in PHYS 111, this course was useful in understanding the overlapping concepts. Idk if this course is curved or what because I calculated my mark to be a 76 but ended with an 82:)

$T$ is one of the most time consuming courses I have taken in Waterloo so far. I generally spent 20-30 hours per assignment, debugging and figuring out solutions to interesting problems. However, I felt that we were given all the resources we needed to figure out the course material, and managed to get a 100% on all the assignments given. The material taught in this course was incredibly interesting, and reveals much of the mysteries behind operating systems that even experienced programmers are often oblivious to. The final grade I received in this course was 87%. For most students, this course will be the first true experience with real low level programming, working at the kernel level. The keys to succeeding in this course are good time management skills, a deep understanding of the C memory model and the O. S. memory models taught in this course, and judicious application of the GDB debugger. I took this course under professor Wong, whom I recommend, although watch out for the midterm if he is lecturing in your offering.

Tips: 1. Do your experiments at a good pace but do it right and make sure you know what you're doing every experiment. A lot of my friends got shitty results/ marks because they rushed their experiments. 2. Titration is key learn how to do it properly. 3. Watch experimental procedure videos before the lab to provide a visual guide for the steps. 4. I like to write out a list of things to complete every lab this keeps me on track. 5. $T$ are AWESOME 6. She'll usually open the lab~ 10 mins early so if you get there early you can start setting up for the lab.( MAKE sure to wash your equipment every lab for best result) 7. Adding onto 6 read the pages in the lab manual detailing how to wash equipment. 8. Keep an eye on your equipment and don't break/ lose them( you don't wanna end up paying for them they are expensive) Final words/ Personal Experience: Heidi scares me but if you follow the above tips you should do fine. Your TAs will be your best friends in this lab get on their good side. Most TAs are really nice so that shouldn't be a problem. Personally I did pretty well in this lab thanks to those tips. Heidi likes to scare you for the first few weeks to make people drop because there's a LONG waiting list for this lab. Shrug her attitude away and focus on your experiment.:) Good luck in the lab!

If you are going into the health sciences, you have to take $T$. If you have to take this class, you should take it with Deeter. He is a very thoughtful, caring professor who will walk you through every assignment. He has a great sense of humor. You have to work your butt off, it's not going to be easy, but it will definately be worth it.

It's a very interesting $T$ because I have never taken one which teachs about business strategy specifically. Although, it's very subjective and the way you describe your answer on the exam matters, but the profs are sometimes lenient in giving you the marks. The exam cases are long and you really need the entire 2 or 3 hrs to do it. Do at least a couple of practice cases before doing the exams, they really help.

This was one of the hardest classes I have taken yet. 50+ pt quiz each week. Big $T$ 150+ pt each. Medical diagrams are hard, she wont tell you which to study. Extra credit is summaries of medical stuff. HW is each week+ due 2 days before class. Friendly and caring but very hard teacher. Class always goes over regular class time extra 20-10mins+

I have major respect for $T$. When he makes a mistake he apologizes& is very fair & genuine. He always makes things right. If you do the assignments, which also are good study tools you will have a good chunk of your grade made. I found the tests to be difficult, but I learned to adjust my study habits& my scores improved. No regrets!

$T$ is a cool guy, but goddamn his grading schemes can be complicated. The textbook is a waste of resources, you dont need it for the whole term b/ c theres no exam, for each project just have your group members use up their free 14 day trial for Mymanagementlab or Pearson or whatever it is. Rent it out of the library too if possible. Never buy a textbook for any SCIBUS course in general. Course material is dry AF and your experience/ ease of the material will solely depend on the quality of your group members and your TA's ability to decipher what they" think" Okey means when it comes to assignment criteria.

$T$ requires your attendance and your complete focus. Professor Mills cover several philosphers over the course of the semester. He is a very good teacher and has a way of making philosphy interesting. You are required to complete essays each week and it counts as 80% of your grade, so do the essays and you will pass the class.

Not very difficult $T$ and final exam was incredibly easy. 90 + easily achievable, but 95 + can be tricky. I was bummed that the final exam did not specifically emphasize the mechanisms but rather throw in irrelevant nit picky questions straight from the slides that test pure memorization rather than learning concepts. Should have made the final exam harder by throwing in the mechanisms because that would have made the exam much more interesting!!!

Very interesting $T$, very math heavy course too! The physics of General Relativity are introduced and taught well. Many of these topics require math not normal covered in the prerequisite chain for this course though. Mathematical concepts( Tensors, Einstein Notation, Differential Geometry, Manifolds) are introduced quickly and you will have to master them on your own. I recommend you take PMATH 365( Differential Geometry) and even PMATH 465( Manifolds) if you want to get a leg up on those topics. At the time of writing, there's no dedicated math course( although Eduardo is pushing to have a Math Phys foundation course), but AMATH 361( Continuum Mechanics) also introduces Tensors+ Einstein Notion in a lighter physics setting with the added bonus of keeping your PDEs skills fresh for GR. If you can get an handle on the math, the physics is really interesting from in-depth Special Relativity, Postulates of GR, Metrics, Einstein Equations, and more!

As an extremely average student, who is not especially good at math, I found $T$ to be both very fun and a bit challenging. Some of the content is hard to understand at first, but as long as you keep grinding out practice problems and spamming questions on Piazza you will be fine! I strongly believe that ANY student that just puts in the time and effort will succeed.

The first half of the course was on China, and the second half was on Japan, Korea, and southeast Asia. The test and assignment questions were focused on history and politics.

$T$ was so poorly organized by TAs and professor. The TAs would dock marks for different things and would never give a straight answer about deliverables. Nobody knows what's going on and check ins + help sessions are so counter productive.

The $T$ is somewhat interesting- it at least opens your mind up to some new paradigms. The emphasis on a really odd code style( outdenting, for(;;), etc.) is a bit unfortunate. It would've been slightly more useful if a practical language was used instead of a pedagogical one( uC++).

The $T$ were interesting but I think they were very outdated. Large portion of the course was spent on traditional AI techniques such as A* search algorithm, constraint satisfaction, and rational reasoning, which aren't very useful. There was little focus on machine learning. The assignments were also not very useful, but they could depend on the the term. It does give an overview of AI so it's worth taking

The $T$ reads like a 1st year course but the midterms were surprisingly hard! Doesn't need as much of a time investment as other 3rd year courses so that's good; doing the readings a few days before the midterms should be okay. Easy to underestimate but also easy to do well in.

I took $T$ for A& P 1 and A& P 2. He is a fantastic professor. He comes in about an hour befor lecture to answer any question you may have. If you are in one of his lab classes he will permit you to attend his other lab class to get extra lab time. Come to class prepared and work for your grade.

Very similar to CHEM 120L. The problem was that $T$ were not in sync, and so we had to do equilibrium problems before we learned them in lecture. Sue does a good job of explaining how to do the problems in the lab manual, but it's a good idea to start them early so you can get help if needed. Lab report marking really depends on how picky your TA is. The experiments done were pretty fun! However the final was not fun because it was very calculation based and felt very long. It was hard because you had to know the methods for a lot of different types of calculations, and having both the CHEM 123 and CHEM 123L exams on the same day didn't help. It definitely brought a lot of marks down.

If you took French up to grade ten, $T$ should be an absolute walk in the park. Most of the things we learned was a natural progression from mid-high school level French, with some review. I actually like this course better than some other 101-level language courses. Also, there's no oral component to the course( so no presentation or video).

I would have liked to see a $T$ similar to MATH 137P& 138P. That being said the course covered exactly as mentioned in the above description( in that order). Assignments and quizzes alternated every week. The quizzes are a bit easier but you have less time and you're more likely to make a mistake. Not too difficult in the end if you go to all the lectures and understand the material. Not many applications, just straight up Calculus.

If you took accounting in high school, you're pretty much set for most of this course.

Although lots of $T$ has been brilliant and I wouldn't trade the friends I have made for anything the academic support is absolutely awful. The staff are unsympathetic, feedback vague and contradictory. I went to my tutor to ask for more detailed feedback or examples of how I could have improved my work and he was unable to go into more detail but considering the mark I was given there must have been a lot there to improve. If you're going to spend £9, 250, spend it on somewhere that actually cares about its students. Exeter only cares about it's reputation and the lecturers are definitely chosen based on their research rather than the quality of their teaching which would be fine but again for the amount of money you would be better off elsewhere.

The $T$ is- in essence- a great way to demonstrate what you learned throughout your undergrad. However, the format of both CIVE400 and this course is terrible. For one, in CIVE400 we were urged not to do a lot of design work and moreso the " qualitative " research part of the project. This is a trick, do as much as you can from the start or you will feel the burn in 401. Your topic and the scope of your topic really have no limitations outside of what you deem is appropriate, and this can be dangerous because no one will tell you if it is too much. For civils, there's not a lot of " innovation " that you'll find yourself doing that will be comparable to the SEs, ECEs, Mech kids and etc. My advice: pick a topic and define a MANAGEABLE amount of work so you don't screw yourself over later. If you're not trying to redefine the entirety of civil engineering and do something simple with your project- you will have a good time. If you're a high flyer and want to design something really insane then I wish you luck: time management and organization are your best friend.

For civils, there's not a lot of " innovation " that you'll find yourself doing that will be comparable to the SEs, ECEs, Mech kids and etc. My advice: pick a topic and define a MANAGEABLE amount of work so you don't screw yourself over later. If you're not trying to redefine the entirety of civil engineering and do something simple with your project- you will have a good time. If you're a high flyer and want to $T$ then I wish you luck: time management and organization are your best friend.

She is the worst $T$ I have ever had. She never actually * taught * anything, but instead let the students attempt the teaching, only to have our hazarded ideas or creative theories received by her trademark ice queen stare... or an occasional," Well, isn't that obvious?" Absolutely useless and should NOT be a teacher.

$T$ requires a lot of memorization but it helps to really know your mechanisms inside out so you can understand how all of the reactions work. Strategy for the synthesis problems are a huge must.

The $T$ had a lot of concepts to cover in the span of the semester. We had 3 exams( 2 midterms, and a final). If you keep up with the content, you should be fine but it is not a bird course, requires quite a bit of effort to understand the content. Took it during a co-op term and the course kept me busy. It was online and the professor went through the content nicely and made notes summarizing important points which were very helpful. I found n older version of the textbook online and I used that and it worked out well. There is also a youtube channel that covers all content thoroughly. Just search the name of the textbook on youtube you should be able to find it, the channel is called FinanceKid.

There are many resources available TAs, course is extremely well organized and book is useful. Level of education I expect from UBC but do not always get. Thank you $T$!

Absolutely one of the best professors I've ever had. In the beginning, hes going to lay down the law. There is NO chewing gum, NO foodwater, and NO lateness. $T$ may come off as mean , BUT don't let that fool you. This man is the best. He tells you what you need to know, he's SUPER FAIR, and he just wants you to learn. Not an easy A but 100 % do-able

I still couldn't tell you what this course is about. The $T$ is genrally relevant , but very random and repetative. In your lecture summaries, make sure to touch on material covered from both lectures and focus on your analysis/ thoughts. Prof ( Qian ) can be a little out of pocket so watch out

Consists of two midterms and a final exam. If you've taken BIOL 110( Zoology), $T$ is the next step up. Lots of content, memorization is necessary. For me, the life cycles were the hardest part of the course, so be sure to review them regularly. I recommend keeping organized charts of the various groups of organisms as you go along, it makes it much easier to study for the tests/ exam. Textbook is useful but not required to do well.

Easiness: Its half credit so the $T$ is much less than any other 1B course. But it's a weird one though, you either get it or don't.

It's a great $T$ to integrate two areas of accounting into one course but considering the time given the organization is horrible, Tax gets curved a lot so there's nothing to worry about. However, in audit, there's no clarity regarding the marking of the integrated audit case, it was difficult to achieve a good mark. Final doesn't get curved a lot and I personally found it harder than the tax exam.

Awesome $T$, very helpful! If you are willing to learn she will go out of her way to make sure you understand everything.( Not sure what the previous poster ment about not being great for females because I never had a problem with her and I know several women that didn't either!)

This is a mandatory course for all undergrad BSc students. It is comprised of 2 $T$ and a final which are all very fair. Often, the first midterm is mainly on high school review and modules 0-1 from the course notes whereas the 2nd midterm is more based on new contents, so modules second half of 1-4. The content itself is pretty easy to understand assuming that you have a great understanding of the concepts taught in grade 12, but if not is also easy to grasp with practice. This class is designed to ensure that students do their best in this course and can be seen through the various questions provided from multiple assignments, online quizzes and clicker questions done throughout the course. BEFORE EACH MIDTERM AND FINAL EXAM: Make sure to do the practice sample midterm / final exam questions provided on Learn as they are very similar ( like 95 %) TO the ones on the midterms. There are also various ways to get help when you do not understand a certain material. The profs for this course also have review sessions before finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice. DISCLAIMER; DO NOT BUY A TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS. I bought just the textbook and not the solutions manual and I did not even open it ONCE. The course notes and the practise questions provided by these profs are enough!!

This $T$ is an approachable and real individual. She is fair in her grading methods, understanding but not to be taken advantage, respectful, and calm & collective. In a nutshell, you will get out of this class whatever you put into it. It is a writing intensive course but she gives you all the materials and guidance you need.

Very sweet and really loves her students. $T$ doesn't speak english well so understanding her is sometimes a problem, but the message always comes through.

The $T$ marked everything and they were super biased. My friend and I would get completely different grades on the weekly responses. Some of the lecturers sucked and were totally boring.

Really easy $T$! I am currently in the 90's. It is really straightforward with weekly assignments that take up to 30 mins to complete. You'll have to write a request, recommendation, and do a crisis communication assignment, all very easy. There is also a final group proposal assignment. The final is literally like doing the assignments all over again consists of a request, recommendation, and bad news letter! It is only worth 25 % as well. A downside to this course is that it heavily depends on your TA. I have friends taking the same course getting lower marks just because of their TA's

This class had AMAZING $T$, lectures, and topics but unfortunately, it has to have been the most disorganized and frustrating class in my whole entire University career so far as a second-year student. To give this course a fair and honest review I will go into it with plenty of depth. Topic-wise I was hooked. I enjoyed learning about protests, criminal law actors, gender, children and youth justice etc, and honestly the lectures were quite relaxed and VERY helpful for the midterm and exams. No lecture slides( which many students disliked)... but I actually found this helpful because the weekly agenda in this course is attending the( 1) lecture and( 2) break out group... then( 3) take notes and you will ace the exams. The breakdown of assignments were okay but I found the marking to be ALL over the place and incohesive. As a strict A or A+ student I was surprised with my low 80 grade on both the written assignment and the oral presentation, and MANY students were appalled with their presentation marks as NO critiques were given yet ended with a low 80. The grades for our Test 1 changed approximately 3 times in the system and it was just all over the place. I am writing this on April 24 and can confidently say this is the ONLY class that I am missing 3/ 6 marks for this late in the term. I have every single solitary mark back( minus exams) in every other course. Students in this class overall have discussed how frustrating and unorganized this is. The professor also makes emailing impossible. Quite literally any small email question will be replied to with" join office hours." The wait for office hours is approx. 30-1. 5 hours. I found this ridiculous and AGAIN the only class I have had so far where emailing was made impossible by the professor. I also know that many students struggled with the fact that lectures were not recorded and if you were sick there was no way other than sharing notes to receive the lecture content( again noting that lecture slides ceased to exist). Overall nice content but extremely disorganized and received lower marks than I was expecting yet this was the easiest LS course I have ever taken. The professor seemed to make this course scary for no reason, stating in lecture 1 that this course would be challenging. This course is NOT challenging and extremely easy and simple yet marking and disorganization made it dreadful!

Overall nice content but extremely disorganized and received lower marks than I was expecting yet this was the easiest LS course I have ever taken. The professor seemed to make this course scary for no reason, stating in lecture 1 that this course would be challenging. This course is NOT challenging and extremely easy and simple yet marking and disorganization made it dreadful!
lectures
Positive
This class had AMAZING content, lectures, and topics but unfortunately, it has to have been the most disorganized and frustrating class in my whole entire University career so far as a second-year student. To give this course a fair and honest review I will go into it with plenty of depth. Topic-wise I was hooked. I enjoyed learning about protests, criminal law actors, gender, children and youth justice etc, and honestly the lectures were quite relaxed and VERY helpful for the midterm and exams. $T$( which many students disliked)... but I actually found this helpful because the weekly agenda in this course is attending the( 1) lecture and( 2) break out group... then( 3) take notes and you will ace the exams. The breakdown of assignments were okay but I found the marking to be ALL over the place and incohesive. As a strict A or A+ student I was surprised with my low 80 grade on both the written assignment and the oral presentation, and MANY students were appalled with their presentation marks as NO critiques were given yet ended with a low 80. The grades for our Test 1 changed approximately 3 times in the system and it was just all over the place. I am writing this on April 24 and can confidently say this is the ONLY class that I am missing 3/ 6 marks for this late in the term. I have every single solitary mark back( minus exams) in every other course. Students in this class overall have discussed how frustrating and unorganized this is. The professor also makes emailing impossible. Quite literally any small email question will be replied to with" join office hours." The wait for office hours is approx. 30-1. 5 hours. I found this ridiculous and AGAIN the only class I have had so far where emailing was made impossible by the professor.

she is an amazing $T$. gives 18 extra points for quizzes from the book. posts powerpoints on blackboard so its not that important to attend class. but gives excellent lectures and if you regularly attend class you'll do good. But if you choose to read from the book only you score around a B. I just 4 absences and got an A+ in her subject.

Winter 2022" online-to-in-person" semester consisted of 10 short quizzes( 5 marked), 6 assignments, and 2 midterm exams( no final exam). Light to moderate $T$.

No physics background is required, but experience in looking at and solving energy equations is very helpful!

$T$ has been by far one of my favorite professors at OU. I would highly recommend this professor to anyone. I always looked forward to going to class because he actually made it enjoyable!

Steve has been by far one of my favorite professors at OU. I would highly recommend this professor to anyone. I always looked forward to going to class because he actually made it enjoyable! There is $T$ every night but it's not graded hard at all! Be sure to take good notes because both the midterm and final are open note and book( yay)!

$T$ is useful for higher level courses math faculty courses such as STAT and CO that require proofs using matrices but is pretty limited in usefulness after that.

I loved $T$!!! Yes she did give only power points that got boring, but she knew her stuff and she gave AWESOME reviews for the test, they were long and detailed, but if you really studied them then you should have had no problem getting an A!!! You need to study for this class, no way around it!!

Had $T$ for lab and he was extremely helpful! He can be a bit grumpy sometimes, but even he blames it on his old age. He is always willing to help during office hours and can be pretty lenient about deadlines if you talk to him. Definitely recommend!

It's quite a straightforward $T$ that unfortunately smashed two useful stats courses together because of the Software Engineering rough schedule. I'm not a fan of it because of that, but I still refer to some of the things I learned from here when I do data-related analyses.

Very birdy $T$, you learn how to communicate in the business world( which is actually quite useless for an engineering major, unless one decides to go work at a bank or finance company). There's a group project at the end which can be annoying and difficult to coordinate since it's a group of 5-6, everyone's on their own schedule( as the course is online..) I did this on a co-op term though, so I wasn't too stressed out.

$T$ are stupid, and have nothing to do with course material. First assignment was a 400 word essay on a news article about fossils.

Took this course online during the Winter 2021 term with Barbara Daly. It was a pretty easy and usually a fun $T$. Learned a lot about Microsoft Word, proper design techniques, photo editing, databases, and a bit about SQL and HTML. I didn't find the course videos that were provided to be particularly useful, and most of the content that you couldn't understand could be searched up on Google. The final unit on FileMaker databases was a bit tricky since most people were not familiar with the program but it was cool to see the final product of a database come to life. Overall, this is a course that I recommend as an elective and the difficulty depends on whether or not you have some prior experience with the course content.

I get why a course with this title needs to exist in the program, but the $T$ is not fun and is deeply problematic( despite ongoing efforts to revamp the course) for reasons that were already mentioned in other reviews, so I won't repeat them. If your FYDP does not have a significant UI component& a good meaty variety of use-cases, make up something else for the project and let your TA know. The weekly deliverables will wear you down; at least make sure to set expectations with your team and spend time splitting up sections in a reasonable way. A midterm would have been useful in this course to take some of the memorization burden off the final. Ultimately just get through the course and celebrate being done the SE463 / 4 / 5 sequence when it's over!

Rabbi Geoffrey Dennis is an awesome teacher. He is kinda all over the place with the class discussions, but they are always related to the subject and are always interesting. I have taken four of his classes. He does a great $T$ where he basically makes an outline for you. Very understanding and an extremely intelligent man!

I had $T$ for Psychology of Leadership& Operations Mgmt. She is a very fair and clear. She can relate the topic to you in everyday realistic terms. She asks that you write a weekly paragraph about what is going on in the world around you. She gives a review sheet so you will know exactly what to study. I got A's in both of her classes.

This $T$ is a brief introduction to Hydraulics and calculating properties throughout a circuit. Calculations wise it's a combination of Fluids 1 content( pipe losses, flow) and control systems( natural frequency springs etc.) They cover a bit of PLC's at the end but nothing too complex. The marking was very fair and reflected lecture content and there are a lot of labs and assignments to boost marks as long as you put the time into them.

An excellent $T$. The first third of the course was a review of high school probability( sample spaces, permutations, combinations, etc.). In contrast, the second half introduced some new concepts such as different distributions( poison, exponential, etc.), expected value/ variance, and multivariate distributions. The hardest part was definitely the last 2 chapters( multivariate distributions/ moment generating functions) as not a lot of time was spent on those sections, but the rest was well paced. For spring 2022, the course was 15% quizzes( best 3/ 6 taken), 25% for the best midterm, 10% for the worst midterm, and 50% for the final. All of the tests / quizzes were fair. All in all, an excellently executed course.

Pre-midterm is almost common sense / high school review, post-midterm it actually starts getting interesting but much more difficult- don't fall behind. Took this course online with $T$- he's a great guy and a great prof, really cares about his students.

VERY helpful and thorough- I've never made a lesson or unit plan before, and by the end of the class I was a whiz. Although $T$ aren't realistic for beginning teachers, it does give us a goal to work toward. He used to teach in high schools and his other job is helping at-risk schools- he knows his stuff! Recommended highly!

I strongly agree that $T$ is not well-designed. I guess the professor who comes up with the idea to let the students ranked by classmates instead of exams hates nerds. I learned nothing in this course. Furthermore, I guess the professors don't realize that peer rankings are influenced by many aspects except the student's performance. Maybe they noticed that, and they just don't care.

The $T$ is really , really cool if you're interested in the cellular functions that go on in the brain. The lab was quite cool, and teaches a lot of the underlying concepts that will be covered. The examination is based on analysis of figures from the textbook- you will want it for this class. Don't buy the courseware if you don't mind filling out a PDF instead of writing on paper. You'll need to, as he says, understand the relationships between the various variables that are manipulated. While not difficult, some people might be turned off by the physics involved in the course.

Easy-ish $T$ if you put the effort in. 3 midterms( consisted of MC, T/ F, and Calculations), 3 assignments( take the 2 highest), and about 10-ish quizzes( Infinite attempts to get marks), plus clickers( and bonus clickers which is a total mark booster). If you have Metzger make sure to do the homework because it really gets it into your head for practice.

Of all the online classes I've taken so far, this one is probably the best. $T$ seems to have been adapted very well to the online learning platform, since most of the content was very well organized on LEARN. Sue Stathopulos is amazing, I've had a great TA so far. The lab test was the only thing that brought my mark down but only because I didn't study very well for it. I would just recommend studying for the lab tests thoroughly and to avoid finishing the pre lab assignments the day of. Overall, probably my favourite course so far!

I might be in the minority, but I loved $T$. It was structured well, gave a good introduction to R, and presented a lot of useful and relevant information in almost every module. There were five quizzes approximately every other week( untimed, 3 attempts, 48-hour window), two R assignments instead of a midterm( which I found to be quite nice), and a 3 hour timed final( which was pretty alright). Make sure to actually try attempting some of the exercises in R( as suggested) in the start of the course, it'll definitely help with the quizzes and assignments. Professor Chause was also pretty nice and always replied quickly to questions from students.

Expecting this to be a cornerstone of the SE program, I was extremely disappointed by $T$. Poorly structured and laid-out as well as scheduled. No body wants to come to an 8 : 30 class when they have 5 classes the same day. Also disliked the wiki approach used to communicate marking schemes/ deadlines/ proposal statuses. Appreciate the flexible deadlines, but in turn this makes it difficult to understand what is expected.

I passed, but I will never take another drawing class as UCF.. will make you hate drawing.

$T$ is hands down the most professional, most caring, and overall best professor for any class I have ever had. Calculus has proven to be an intensely difficult course, but he makes it manageable. he gives out note packets that you do, in full, in class and the tests are exactly like to them, and the optional homework.

$T$ was amazing. For the first time, there's no worrying about your lab partner: it's just you and the chemicals. When I took this course, it was just 4 long experiments and you organize your time accordingly throughout the semester: for students taking it in Fall 2016, you now have 7+ experiments, so I'm not sure how much the formatting's changed. It's a lot of work, but it's incredibly rewarding. I loved it.

It's a class. The $T$ is quite mundane, especially towards the end of the semester. There are numerous " required " ways to read weekly material, audio, textbook and lecture notes, and it just feels like way too much content when pages are filled from top to bottom with words. The assignments are straightforward, but very easy to not do well on given that you don't really get practice on how to do anything asked in them. Still not a bad class, just not as interesting as it seemed.

This apartment is the best I've come across since I came to Exeter. It is well equipped with a gym and a large leisure area. The front desk of the apartment was also very enthusiastic, especially a sister named $T$.

This is the second class I took $T$ Radin for. I purposely choose an 8am class just so I could take her again. Students who dislike her typically don't enjoy participating in class. She will force you add something to the class. Don't just expect to sit there. She is gives tons of real life advice. She makes every class fun and lively.

Go to the $T$!! A lot of the TAs aren't the greatest so it's important you go to the open labs where the TAs are amazing and you learn the whole experiment no problem.

ECE 198 is a poorly constructed attempt at familiarizing students with the STM Nucleo board that they will use for ECE 298. By all means this is a bird $T$, but a bird course with communication with course instructors solely through Piazza and instruction solely through prerecorded videos on LEARN( at least during online schooling), making understanding the deliverable requirements incredibly frustrating. The lack of smaller deadlines makes it all too easy to procrastinate major parts of the project until the few days before it's due. For your own sake, forget about being unique or creative and choose the easiest project under the" challenging" category, because I sure wish I did. Do well on your documentation and your final grade will be good even if your project doesn't work.

The clubs and societies are reasonably diverse, but the music school is not very good. It doesn't encourage people to play, and Kay House two miles away, too far to carry instruments.

did have mutliple computer/ other problems, therefore never returned an assignment in a reasonable timely fashion.
Took this F2020, the damned $T$... Weekly assignment was one question long and hella easy, start early and the proof will click after you stare at them for long enough. Even though the quiz was structured terribly( no going back to previous questions, has to select all correct choice for mark) we got 2 attempts for most of them. I thought I enjoyed calculus but then I take MATH 137. First half was quite rough at first, I legit stared at the true definition of limits for 20 minutes straight, but second half got way easier. All of my friends in upper year did decent or well in this class but I'm the only one who did terrible, I guess calculus is just not it for me.

By far the worst $T$ I have taken. She is very unorganized and is not willing to help students pass. She refuses to give study guides or any guidance. She has little patience when asking questions and assumes that everyone already knows the course information. I wish I would've known how awful this class was before I had taken it.

The first two thirds tears through mostly high school review, last third is mostly new. $T$( the first) was very fair. Engelhardt's midterm( the second) was challenging but also fair.

I took $T$ expecting it to be easy. I wouldn't call it hard, but it is a 4th year course and should not be underestimated. Don't put off the assignments until the last minute, they are more complicated than they seem when you first read them. The course covers a lot more material than the assignments cover. Assignments are basically all socket programming, while the course material covers all aspects of networking( which would be difficult to make programming assignments for).

Honestly the birdiest of bird courses. Get a buddy, alternate doing the quizzes / midterm after a few hours studying each and you'll get an easy 90. No need to go to $T$ at all.

She is the worst $T$ ever... Her exams are essay all written and even if you miss a single word on the essay she cuts of 6 points in the essay. Don't take her if you want an A. Her notes are useless you have to read the book to understand what she writes because her notes are very unclear. And on top of everything else she gives you attitude.

The bane of my existence this term. I've heard it's easier with $T$ so take with her if you would like to keep your sanity. I find that with Reed and Marsden, it is impossible to do well. Even if I stay up to date every week and understand and memorize the slides. Even if I do all the study questions. The exam questions seem to be straightforward but really aren't. I don't plan on going into research so it's pretty useless. Mammalian embryology and neurulation have been the most fascinating topics so far. I would enjoy it a lot more if I didn't have to look at my grade book.( I took this course online F20)

She's nice and approachable, but also knows her stuff. The $T$ are interesting and good for both RHCS-majors and gen electives. Class is heavily discussion based, with her serving as a moderator/ agenda setter, which occasionally gets repetitive. Not hard to succeed, but put in the work and you will learn as well.

$T$ is the most unprepared and boring professor I have ever had. Attendance is mandatory and he treats the students like they are elementary school age, making us sign in after break. That being said, he is an extremely easy grader, almost everyone gets an A. Be prepared to spend 3 hours a week learning what NOT to do to inspire your students.

Dog-eat-dog mentality, will hand you' L's in front of the whole class and gives you more assignments than you can possibly hope to finish. $T$ also made us read and respond to all these 60pg articles and have hour long discussions that cut in on painting time. Basically, a mom that you try to strive for her approval but will never ever ever get.

Took it with Gurfinkel and was not expecting to be doing so much theory for a" bird" $T$. Guess the course description is really up to interpretation by the prof teaching it. We only talked about actual unit testing for a few weeks, then got into symbolic execution, propositional/ first order logic, Hoare logic( CS 245 anyone??), and deductive verification( at least this was slightly enjoyable). 3 assignments, 2 open book quizzes. Final was also open book, but very long and many people didn't finish.

Took Online Fall 2020. Just a buildup on Math 136, but the $T$ made me struggle to remember what I learned. As the course kept progressing and after a lot of review many things I started to understand more and more. Assignments were weekly, but short and concise with a very very tedious Mobius portion that often took hours to complete. Many questions at first seemed to contrast textbook practice questions, but nonetheless not bad compared to other courses. Overall pretty decent considering it's just linear algebra and the usual proofs.

Very fun $T$. It seems like there are two different offerings of CS341. Aptitude for the course seemed pretty bimodal- some folks would look at a problem and it would immediately click, others would eventually stumble on a good enough solution and call it a day. If you have a competitive programming background, have no fear.

This is not an easy course but it is doable. What I kind of liked in $T$ was that it deals with optimization problems so big that you don't solve the real world problems by hand, you write them out and get a computer to solve them for you. However, there are certain ways which improve how a computer will arrive at an answer and this course is designed to teach a ) how to solve the problems and b ) the best strategies for solving these problems. This hasn't always been considered in previous courses and I liked that. A little meta trying to optimize an optimization program. I'd recommend this course if anyone wan't to further their optimization skills or is looking for a challenge.

However, there are certain ways which improve how a computer will arrive at an answer and this course is designed to teach a ) how to solve the problems and b ) the best strategies for solving these problems. This hasn't always been considered in previous courses and I liked that. A little meta trying to optimize an optimization program. I'd recommend $T$ if anyone wan't to further their optimization skills or is looking for a challenge.

The dept should pay that tutor instead of him because he is the worst chem prof ever. disorganized, useless $T$, rude, doesn't know the your name the whole semester so you can't expect any Recc. letters if you want later on.

I think the $T$ itself was somewhat enjoyable, though I didn't like the assessments. The weekly Mobius Quizzes, worth 40% of your grade, each contain 10 multi-select choice questions; each question is a trick question designed to trick the student into selecting an incorrect choice rather than actually testing to see if the student understands the material. What's more, if you select 4/ 5 of the correct choices on a multi-select choice question, then you still get 0 marks for that question. To be fair, you do get 2 attempts per quiz, but it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth that the Mobius Quizzes are designed to bring down the average rather than actually test student understanding of the material. The midterm was a bit brutal for some, but the final was definitely easier.

Dry $T$, outdated contents, horrendously written slides. The assignments are extremely ambiguous; piazza is a graveyard of unanswered questions.

I found $T$ to be a bit dry. Some of the data structures covered were weird and don't seem to be actually used in the real world. The proofs were hand-wavey and aren't done properly.

I took $T$ as a bird, it is not bird!! I took it to boost my average and I'm pretty sure its my lowest grade. I enjoyed the content cause it really makes you think about who Jesus was a human and a divine being which is incredible to me, but the books are so boring and so long. I would definitely take it again if it wasn't being graded lol

It was an easy $T$, but maybe too easy for today's students who are already literate in social media. However, some concepts we learned were thought-provoking and I found it hard to cross the low 80's threshold.

A real $T$. You will learn how to actually think mathematically since you probably don't know yet. An excellent course for the very foundation of math.

OK the $T$ is easy...( other than stereochemistry because some students have better perception than others). Focus more on doing the questions than memorising the concepts. Just be alert when it comes down to testing because they'll throw some devious questions, especially if you have chong. Oh... and DO NOT MEMORISE THE REACTIONS ENTIRELY!!!! Try to see why the reactions occur the way it is, and after you will see that the majority of the reactions occur in a similar way and follows a similar logic

For an introductory level class, $T$ expects you to have to be a expert in science and a expert in evolutionary anthropology which is his department.

The worst $T$ I have ever had. She cancels class , but doesn't bother to notify the class. She scheduled an audition during class. After preparing for monologues, she told us the class was going on a field trip to her audition instead. I could have been devoting time to class assignments that actually mattered. Worst experience ever at DePaul.

The $T$ is pretty interesting. But the exams are horrible, and the prof teaching it lied the difficulty.

Shame, because the content is pretty useful and interesting, especially when we take on full time jobs, mortgages, leases etc.

Good $T$. I learned a lot about C++ and how to design OOP programs. I came from advanced first year courses, so having no release tokens( a way to see the number of test cases you passed) made it much more difficult. Fortunately, the instructors encouraged testing and even gave us marks for making our own tests. To be honest, the assignments weren't very interesting, but I still think they were useful. I found the quizzes easy since most of the questions I could just type in an editor and run some code to double check my answers. I took this course online, so all I had were assignments, quizzes, and a final project. I did the one-person project( I recommend choosing this if you just want to save time). It was pretty simple to do and can be implemented in one or two day if you create a good design. For the more difficult assignments, I recommend starting right away as they can be hard to debug and implement.

Solid $T$. Course content is not very complicated, but it introduces some very important concepts such as concurrency control and multithreading. The most challenging part of the course is the lab, where you build a mini OS throughout the term. Although not conceptually hard, getting the implementation right and debugging your code can be quite difficult.

Weekly assignments, $T$ is pretty difficult( got a 55%), final even harder. Do your work, be sure to stay on top of the lecture material and the assignments, and do the readings! They explain a lot of what the professor doesn't have time to write on the board, it's kind of like " prep " material for the assignments / midterms. If you're falling behind, use the first-year resources to get back on track. There's tutorials, TA hours, and office hours for the professors themselves if you can't wrap your head around a specific concept or assignment.

He's actually a pretty good $T$ and a really nice guy. He's always willing to spend extra time helping students understand the material. If you disrupt his class by laughing, talking to classmates or sleeping he'll yell at you but if you pay attention and do homework he'll set you up for success.

$T$ is not easy but also not hard. Going to the lectures helps a lot , but it's not required. However, if you do go to the lectures and you don't understand something, you can ask her questions after and she'll explain more in depth until you get the concept. The midterm / final is pretty straight forward, you just need to know your content, and be able to write continuously through the entire time given because it's short/ long answers.

Nice $T$ that teaches you how to write simple code. But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe( especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important. All course contents are based on a website and you have to read everything and code something on that website. Pity that this course will not show many algorithms or data structures. So far I think those who can just play computer games( i. e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard) can easily get 90 + in this course. If you have ever coded like C , python , java , pascal and so on , easy to get 95 +. Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material( okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)

I found $T$ to be more fast-paced than chem 266 and the amount of reactions / mechanisms you had to memorize was pretty overwhelming. Steven Forsey was a good prof, you could tell he cared about his students because he made an effort to remember peoples names and was very chatty. I found his explanations could be a little scattered sometimes, but he was very patient with all the questions he would get from students. This is the lowest grade I've gotten in a course so far, but I still finished with an 82 so its really not as bad as people make it out to be. Because chem 266 was online, the midterm( 25%) and final( 55%) were open book( not sure if it will be this way for future terms tho).

Steven Forsey was a good prof, you could tell he cared about his students because he made an effort to remember peoples names and was very chatty. I found $T$ could be a little scattered sometimes, but he was very patient with all the questions he would get from students. This is the lowest grade I've gotten in a course so far, but I still finished with an 82 so its really not as bad as people make it out to be. Because chem 266 was online, the midterm( 25%) and final( 55%) were open book( not sure if it will be this way for future terms tho).

The tests are all really heavily based on the $T$, which can be quite dull. The lectures are interesting, but unfortunately the attending the lectures isn't enough to get you a reasonable / passable mark in this course. A lot of the content is quite obvious, too, or at least we don't go too in-depth with the non-obvious stuff.

$T$ is just TTS for slideshows and has one of the most mind-numbing voices I've ever heard. Don't bother showing up to class. Three evaluations: Midterm, Final, and a 10k word essay. The Midterm and Final are selections from his practice midterm/ final, but you need to write way more than the answers given in the practice exams. He makes you find someone to take pics of you every 10 minutes to " prove " you aren't cheating. Don't leave the essay til the last minute. 10k is longer than you think. Birdy, but useless. The slideshows are just wiki articles laid out schizophrenically.

She's very friendly and makes one feel at home. Here's the thing though: There's only so much $T$ can help you with something like Math. If you can go home and review the chapter from the book and do just a few of the questions testing those concepts, you'll kill it. Most of her tests are MCQ tests! She also makes it a point to review all tests.

Took this course as a first year because I couldn't get into ANTH100. $T$ was pretty interesting, not useful. We spent way too much time on learning how to perfectly hit a rock ( flintknapping ) which I wouldn't say is very useful especially since we didn't do any field work throughout the course. The work itself was easy, we wrote a couple annotated bibliogrpahy, two essays which we were given pretty free reign on. I got above 85% for all the assignments.

Easy $T$ are 10%. 5% in-lab subjective mark by your TA. 45% is the lab reports( only one is a full report), 40% exam. Anyone who says this exam was difficult is exaggerating. It's the same day as the CHEM 120 exam, with 120 being in the morning and 120L being at night. Honestly, I only studied for this exam after the 120 exam, and I still did fine. Just read over the lab manual a few times and it won't be bad at all.

I don't like $T$. This course was better than expected for an English course and took it cause I didn't want to do public speaking. Had 3~ 1500 word papers and like 5 mini( 500 word) assignments. Attendance is taken but only useful thing I learned from class was a good method of writing the first drafts( sit down and force yourself to write a terrible draft start to finish). For each paper we had a peer editing day which was nice.

I don't like English / writing. This course was better than expected for an English course and took it cause I didn't want to do public speaking. Had 3~ 1500 word papers and like 5 mini( 500 word) assignments. Attendance is taken but only useful thing I learned from class was $T$( sit down and force yourself to write a terrible draft start to finish). For each paper we had a peer editing day which was nice.
a good method of writing the first drafts

This is the bird course of all bird courses. I took $T$ online fall 2021. There are only 5 or so assignments in the entire course. I did most of them in around 5 hours each, over one or two days. I got an 80. Sometimes I forgot I even was taking it. The content is somewhat Interesting, but there is very little actual information. In my opinion, the entirety of the course could be learned in a weekend, unless you have literally never thought about geography concepts before. A good course to take to get used to the uni workflow in your first semester.

Bit of review from grade 12 vectors but mostly new. 3D based for the most part. $T$ can be challenging and time consuming. The tutorial quality was inconsistent but most of the time they were good. Some weeks it would be very short, some weeks we would run out of time. Project wasn't too demanding but the instructions could have been better. It was run by the TAs. How well you do on the midterm and final depends on how good your cheat sheet is. You are allowed the formula book for both.

This course taught a bunch of important $T$ that will most likely be needed in future courses. Unfortunately, the fact that Chong teaches this means that: 1. RIP your GPA. 2. Things tend to be confusing because his notes are just all over the place. I probably would have enjoyed this course a lot more if another professor were teaching it.

$T$ was super helpful and would often go off topic to answer students questions or give tips for our terrible placements. She had many different teaching strategies. She would lecture, do group activities, bring candy. She even suggested the whole class wear pj's to class one night. She would teach until 9 , but time would fly.

I am, beyond upset that i trusted other students on flow to adequately describe $T$.. 93% easy is absolute bull. So the content is not all that bad, but its not EASY by any means. Add this to the fact that you have to fill in 100 marks of non multiple choice questions in a 50 minute midterm and you do not have " an easy 90 ". The reason why a lot of people likely thought that this course was easy, is because there is a circulating google doc that has all the previous midterms/ tests in it. Therefore, if you have an extensive social group, you were bound to get the doc early, and study only according to the doc, and therefore were likely to get a solid 100% for solely memorizing what you knew would be tested. However, if you are like me, and had to do it the old fashioned way and try to study everything and only focusing heavily on the stuff that he stressed in class, it is a much different story. Now i wasn't expecting extremely easy, but i was hoping it would balance out my other 4th year courses and it is currently my lowest grade out of all 6. So if you are considering taking this course because you need a higher level course, but still want to get a good grade relatively easily, Would not recommend.

$T$ is interesting. Don't get me wrong, I have learned things in his class but sometimes he is strict about things such as the class not knowing a certain tense or il est vs c'est.

$T$ has got issues. I'm not going to lie. It's basically an overview of all of the brain modeling techniques in the past. For me, that's exactly what I wanted. For everyone else, this might be hell. One huge problem with the course is it's mostly just humongous walls of text. If you're a visual learner, this is basically just a giant " fuck you ". Also the assigned reading are basically useless. On the bright side, it is really easy. All you need to do is write essays.

Vice versa if you have an overvalued currency, you spend more and save less. Of course, it's good policy to have certain amount of reserve, too much reserve lowers citizen's living condition and too little reserves mean you will be at the mercy of a poor global economy.

$T$ should prob not be teaching precalc. i am good at math and she confused me. web hw( 20% of the grade) took up way too much time that i needed for other classes and it made me ignore the daily hw that she doesnt go over anyway. tests are looong and hard. 5 people actually lasted to the final. she is dedicated but not great at actually teaching.

$T$ is no where near as bad as all of the other whining nursing students say he is. He will help you out if you are truly interested in learning the material. He is also one of the nicest profs I have had so just talk to him if you have any problems. He would love to help you!

Blum's a pretty cool $T$. Tests weren't hard especially if you understand the material and have a good page of notes. Make sure to do all of the homework and learnsmart assignments, as well as go to class for free clicker points that will help your grade in the end.

$T$ has been the one of the best decisions I have made. I hated secondary school due to personal problems yet I always loved learning. I came to Exeter for a fresh start and to have the social life I never had in my childhood and it has been the best thing that has happened to me. I have made some amazing friends and there are so many opportunities that the university offers from day one. I'm first year and am already part of an international synthetic biology competition over the summer! The amount of support offered is incredible and the campus is beautiful. The local nature walks and wildlife all around is truly special.

The first half of the $T$ is numerical methods, while the second half is PDEs. The content taught sounds interesting on paper, and it really does have potential if handled correctly. Unfortunately, the execution is very poor and you're left just memorizing equations and algorithms with no intuition as to how they were developed or why they're important. The only good unit is analytical solutions to PDEs, which is the very last one. You need to blindly suffer through iterating through algorithms by hand for 5 units first. MATLAB should also be formally taught within the lectures if it's going to be used on projects and specifically asked upon during exams. This course spends a lot of time teaching things that won't be useful. Regardless, it's still the best course of the term overall for at least having some interesting content.

$T$ shouldn't be a requirement to CS. Make sure you learn EVERYTHING in this course, in particular the normal/ gaussian, poisson, and exponential distributions, and MEMORIZE all the formulas on the formula sheet. If you don't you WILL FAIL STAT 231. I had to WD 231 because I didn't do this course well enough. Hoping I pass it the second time around...

having done AP calculus in high school, $T$ should have been a breeze, but i was surprised as to the fact that is wasn't as easy as i thought it would be. content wise, it covers all the functions done in high school, limits and derivatives, and an intro into integration. the midterm was quite hard and the profs had to propose an alternate grading scheme to help students from a poor performance, which had an average in the 60s. florian girelli is great at explaining concepts and makes sure his students know what typical" traps" students normally fall in on midterms and exams and how to avoid them. however, he does go quite fast in the notes and it seems as if you are expected to know the content before hand, but not everyone does. he does have a lot of clicker questions in the lecture to practice the math. the final was fair and if you practice the final exams given from previous years, it is very similar to those.

$T$ is a tough cookie. She won't take anyone's easy way out of doing the work... knows all the usual," my dog ate my catalogue." or" too hungover to go to the museum. I prefer that. Needed a challenge and she was it. I honor a professor that has guts to stand up to the students. Suggestion... buy a laptop to keep up with the notes.

You can do really well on $T$ if you work together in groups. Don't be afraid to ask him questions about the assignments! There was a final group project consisting of a presentation and a briefing paper on a topic of your choosing( relating to a problem with a fish stock). Assignments were given at the end of each unit( 6 assignments total). There was a take-home final exam which we were given a weekend to complete. I would recommend taking BOIL 361 prior to this course as a background in statistics is very helpful. Knowledge of linear regression , confidence intervals , and T-tests are vital to doing well in this course.

Didn’t take any $T$. This course was really easy, no need to read the textbook, the course notes are enough. You get 12 weekly quizzes, 2 group discussions, 1 midterm and the final. The first weekly quiz is ungraded and then the marks of 10 best quizzes out of 11 are considered which amounts to 40% of your grade. We also have 2 group discussions worth 10% each which are very easy. You can easily get a 9/10 in the discussions. The midterm contained 50mcq and the final consisted of 50mcqs and 5 short answer questions. Prof kumase did some review sessions on webex occasionally. These are recorded and can help you understand the concepts more clearly. It’s definitely a bird course. Spent only about a maximum of 4-5 hours per week. Ended up with a 93.

Get ready for an extremely independent $T$ with little to no input from the Prof or the TA. You are completely on your own, no review , no nothing. Just listen to 12 Modules each consisting of 13-115 mins of lecture. No lecture notes, and you can't download the videos. A total of 3 online 80 question multiple choice tests, and a 500 word final course reflection, then a 30% final exam; written in person. Very bird, but very dry and dull content at times.

Class is 4 tests which are 80 multiple choice and 2 essay each. Questions on final are copied and pasted directly from first 4 tests. Doesn't take attendance but you WILL fail if you miss $T$

We learned Chicago citations in this course, but I haven't used it since. $T$ was relatively easy up until the final paper for some reason. Since this course is mandatory for Arts students, I'd recommend finding a topic that seems fun and enrolling in it early. Images at Work was okay if you like paintings.

This is an interesting $T$ and is not too bad. There are weekly tutorials with mandatory attendance but were never too burdensome. The midterm was fair and was easy thanks to the practice midterm Dr. Dupont posts on LEARN. Some questions on the final were kinda gimmicky( by that I mean pure memorization), but it was overall very fair and interesting. Dr. Dupont also gives out 5 % bonus for completing activities and that really helped me boost up my final grade.

Most agree, $T$ is brilliant, but DONT be afriad to ask him to explain further, or ask questions. He LOVES participation in class, and almost always forgets to take the attendance roll. He is a funny character with a lot to say and a lot of knowledge to share. This is a Four day class, with 8 hrs of homework a week tops. I suck at math.

I wouldn't say the course is hard but there are a few $T$ that are unforgiving to students and particularly harsh when marking. Some of them mark based on their own preferences, rather than follow the mark scheme. This was made very clear by the comments they wrote on students' assignments. So, this can make or break your experience.

$T$ is the nicest lady ever; if you have any problems she is always willing to help. Pitt Law needs more professors like her who actually care( most professors just give scantron tests , don't even know your name, and hate the fact they have to teach)-- you can tell, though, that Teeter knows her stuff, and likes and is good at teaching.

The online version didn’t have any lectures, just notes. For some of the assignments, I felt like the $T$ did not cover enough material to do them( had to look at the exercise solutions). But maybe I’m just too dumb for this course. 100 % of your grade is assignments, which was awesome.

I fail to see how this course fits in the MAcc program. It's essentially an Online Course but I cannot gather any interests for it, since the $T$, teachings, and assignments are useless. The readings do not reinforce the required work. I did all my assignments without having to read anything. The teachings were also not necessary since I did not attend a single lecture. The fact that there were literally no expectations for students to show up or care( since you're capped at 80 %) is a big turnoff for students. The readings were lengthy , boring , outdated , and not interesting at all. Most assignments are full of typos and as if someone came up with them last minute. The entire course is focused on such a niche area of law, yet it's so simple that I can essentially do the entire course in 1 week. Most students did their submissions by the first half of the course, and did nothing( thus learned nothing) for the 2nd half, and the instructor made little efforts to make us learn. The instructor fails to invoke our interests in the course and he doesn't care about our well-being either. Instructor refuses any regrades and claims that he's" busy" and declines meetings with students who wish to improve, despite only teaching 2 courses. If you cannot commit to teach( due to side projects or research), then don't teach. Our tuition in MAcc is high, and we do not want a course that adds no value to our professional careers. The students who marked our assignments and papers are not even Waterloo students. Fairness & objectivity in grading is a serious flaw in this course. There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask," are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments"? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80 %. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that," no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour. The lack of fairness further destroys any remaining value that is left in this course.

There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask," are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments"? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80 %. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that," no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour. The lack of fairness further destroys any remaining value that is left in this course.
readings
Negative
I fail to see how this course fits in the MAcc program. It's essentially an Online Course but I cannot gather any interests for it, since the readings, teachings, and assignments are useless. The readings do not reinforce the required work. I did all my assignments without having to read anything. The teachings were also not necessary since I did not attend a single lecture. The fact that there were literally no expectations for students to show up or care( since you're capped at 80 %) is a big turnoff for students. The readings were lengthy , boring , outdated , and not interesting at all. Most $T$ are full of typos and as if someone came up with them last minute. The entire course is focused on such a niche area of law, yet it's so simple that I can essentially do the entire course in 1 week. Most students did their submissions by the first half of the course, and did nothing( thus learned nothing) for the 2nd half, and the instructor made little efforts to make us learn. The instructor fails to invoke our interests in the course and he doesn't care about our well-being either. Instructor refuses any regrades and claims that he's" busy" and declines meetings with students who wish to improve, despite only teaching 2 courses.

There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask," are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments"? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80 %. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that," no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour. The $T$ further destroys any remaining value that is left in this course.

Loved the $T$ in this course! A lot of the methods that were covered helped me understand cell biology / biochem research much better. If you are thinking of going into research, you should take this course very seriously and keep good notes. Studying for the exam can be difficult because it is a bit of memory work, but you also have to understand WHY the method is used and WHY certain steps are performed in the method. Study very early for the exam, about a month in advance!

$T$ was MUCH more difficult than CHEM 266. The material in CHEM 266 all made a lot of sense and most of the mechanisms could be easily rationalized. However, the material and mechanisms in CHEM 267 were complicated and largely " exceptions " to the rules taught in CHEM 266. The examples discussed in lecture are also 10x easier than the examples you will be given on the exams. You MUST keep up with the material in this course.

Not an easy $T$ but I manged to get a high C, almost B. She makes you do so many little projects that take A LOT of effort and they're only worth like 5 or 10 pts. If you're lazy DO NOT TAKE. In order to do well you must do all of your work and study hard for the tests. You will need to read your book and notes in order to pass tests.

Had this back in S19. $T$ is useful for future material science courses in MME. A lot of the content is somewhat abstract. Not a lot of math involved with the course, mostly memorization. Tutorials were basically free marks but you had to complete the questions before it started. TA was well organized but passive aggressive towards the students. Labs were interesting but they were ahead of lectures, making for some confusing reports. Midterm and final are easy if you understand the concepts. The multiple choice section is basically random stuff from the slides. Also had the messiest formula sheets I've ever seen.

Had this back in S19. Course is useful for future material science courses in MME. A lot of the content is somewhat abstract. Not a lot of math involved with the $T$, mostly memorization. Tutorials were basically free marks but you had to complete the questions before it started. TA was well organized but passive aggressive towards the students. Labs were interesting but they were ahead of lectures, making for some confusing reports. Midterm and final are easy if you understand the concepts. The multiple choice section is basically random stuff from the slides. Also had the messiest formula sheets I've ever seen.

$T$ is very useful and would definitely help Environment and Business students in their other courses as well as upper-level EB courses. You are more than ready for the midterm if you do the midterm practice questions. It is overall a very straight forward class, and I recommend attending lectures to take notes because not everything would be posted on the slides.

$T$ is a good professor, but she won't accept late work, so don't cut it close when turning in assignments. If you need to talk to her about something, she checks her e-mail pretty frequently, and regarding extra credit, you can get up to 15 points worth of it.

I have her for behav. neuro and $T$ is terrible at explaining. Shows us almost irrelevant videos and doesn't understand questions asked. Very vague with concepts- students have to explain to other students about the material. Has an annoying and nervous habit... do switch out if you get her.

To talk about the university, an amazing university I have ever come across. This might sound silly but when I got the list of universities to shortlist them I don’t know why but all of a sudden after reading the name $T$ I decided the I will be going to this particular university itself. And now I think I made a best choice. The campus is amazing, the faculties are like a best friends to us, they just don’t teach also they provide us all the sources. Campus is fully packed with events and other activities every now and then. There always something to learn from the campus. I m glad enough that I chose this university for my masters ❤️

Took it with David Jao. There was heavy emphasis on the $T$ which made the course seem not immediately useful, but the theories made the concepts more memorable. You would learn enough basics of game theory to learn more on your own. Final project was writing an AI for a variant of chess game, and mark was given based on standings( zero/ constant sum game!). Assignments were short and exams were fair imo. But concepts were tough.

$T$ and stat 333 are two of my favourite stat courses. Took both with Yi Shen and he is the best stat prof I had during my undergrad studies. Super smart and clear with the topics and explanations. The courses remind me of math239/249 which requires lots of intuition. Stat 433 is harder than 333 as it requires you to also have good foundations of linear algebra and calculus to do the calculation. knowledge from stat 330/331 also becomes more important for 433. really recommend it if you love 333 and have solid math foundations. topics include: review of dtmc, ctmc, birth and death process, queueing theory, dph/ cph, renewal process

$T$ is broken down into 3 distinct sections/ units, and there's a test for each. The format is good, the content is relatively clear, and Fillion offers PDF's of the textbook that doesn't cover the units from CHEM 264/5 textbook. The last unit organometallics( Fillion's specialty), doesn't really require understanding. Just know the movements in the cycles and you're good to go! The exam was surprisingly easy and brought up everyone's marks by 4-5 %. The tutorial is very useful( he sometimes uses it as a fourth hour of class), and there's a participation quiz that has really helpful questions for the midterms / exams( plus you get a minimum of 70 % no matter what!). For the midterms, definitely find old tests as they are not super hard but it's a long midterm in only one hour- definitely was rushed for time. Overall, I thought the easiest of all the orgo courses I've taken.

The exam was surprisingly easy and brought up everyone's marks by 4-5 %. The tutorial is very useful( he sometimes uses it as a fourth hour of class), and there's a participation quiz that has really helpful questions for the midterms / exams( plus you get a minimum of 70 % no matter what!). For the $T$, definitely find old tests as they are not super hard but it's a long midterm in only one hour- definitely was rushed for time. Overall, I thought the easiest of all the orgo courses I've taken.

thought $T$ class would be a lot more interesting than it was. content isnt too bad but had 3 profs that alternated and all delivered the content in different ways so it was hard to judge what was important and what was not. assignments aren't too bad, helpful to boost your mark. got some valuable information out of the course but it could have been delivered in a more engaging way.

Very hard $T$ to prepare for. Might wanna try and do each assignment before class so you know what you're doing and you don't run out of time. Otherwise you learn some very valuable skills relating to data manipulation within excel.

$T$ is THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHER EVER !!! She's very helpful, and she will have quizzes base on reading. For in class writing, she will let you practice those stories or terms on quizzes and in class discussions. She will give like 8% of the total grades which 120pts. I took English 010, 100, and 110 with her, and I strongly recommended to u

I took $T$ early in the morning at 9AM which was tough because he is very monotone and boring. He goes through the lecture pretty quickly too, and chem is a lot to take in.

He means well, but above all else as an $T$ he is: unclear , impossible to follow , disorganized , and messy. When I say impossible to follow, I mean it's pointless going to lecture because you will have no idea what the man is saying. Not even like the material is too hard, but like he cannot teach and it's all random nonsense. Open note tests

One of my absolute favourite courses during my undergrad career. Possibly the birdiest $T$ I've ever taken. Despite being very easy, It was not boring at all and the material was genuinely intriguing. If you have even the slightest interest in physical geography this course is a free 90. You learn about timezones, volcanoes, earthquakes, global warming, etc. Would highly recommend. Must go to class though if you have Christine Dow.

The $T$ was alright, but the TAs ruined it. I have never had such hard markers from TAs. I am an upper year that holds a steady 85-90s and I couldn't get past an 80 in this class. When asked to provide further feedback, little was given. I am not sure if it was profession driven or if the few TAs that marked my material were just on a power trip.

Clearly $T$ does not prepare for class. He spends the majority of class simply reading out loud from the textbook. Lame.

If you have a choice, choose a different prof.

Make sure to attend every $T$. There is alot of reading-3 journal articles per week. The class discussions are relevant and very interesting. The group project is easy if you have a good group. No exams, weekly quizzes, and a final paper( 5 pages). Dr. Davis goes over the readings before the quiz is due. Also very helpful with all other work.

You kind of get the basic knowledge of environmental problems, economics, governance, ecology etc. but it's not a very exciting $T$. There is no midterm so your grade is based off of a term paper and the final exam which is worth 60%.

Average $T$, not too easy , not too hard. I passed with an A. Boesiger isn't horrible, but not great either. You basically do the work and you should be fine. He was a little unclear on some stuff, but overall a decent teacher. Attendance not mandatory, but recommended to get good grade. You absolutely need the textbook to pass.

Amazing $T$, completely changed the way I understood calculus. The way concepts and proofs are introduced made them intuitive and easy to understand. The assignment questions are not easy, but allowed you to discover really interesting properties and proofs on your own. Came into this course without much of a mathematics background, but learnt a lot.

My $T$ so far has been excellent, I love the area mostly due to friendly locals, lots to do and a decent night out. The facilities are great although in busier rooms it gets hella sweaty. Halls were much nicer than alot of the places I looked at and really good value too. The teaching staff on my course have been really good, entertaining and obviously knowledgeable, they were really helpful and most of them actually knew my name which was impressive with a course of 200+.

Difficulty: on one hand, the $T$ is really simple and it takes no time to understand. On the other hand, the assignments are so goddamn long. No amount of skill from cs14x or AP java has saved me from this monkey grinding. Every meaningless hour I spend on these tedious assignments eats away at my soul. Usefulness: this is probably the most practical course I've taken thus far, and I've gotten pretty good with standard linux development tools. That said, it's not worth the time I had to put in( see above).... I'll go finish my assignment now

A very fun $T$ to learn about the design process about creating a product( in our case a mobile application). Took with Edith Law and we had no coding nor a midterm or final and the grade was based on weekly milestones regarding the final project.

Interesting $T$. If you have even the slightest interest in mental disorders and viewing them from a clinical perspective, you'll enjoy it. Lots of information was covered, but exams were non-cumulative( 2 midterms and a final for F15 term) and fair- if you attend every lecture and keep up with readings it's hard to leave with anything less than an 80.

Grade 12 Data Management
Positive
$T$ is very useful for a variety of disciplines involving statistics. If you have studied math courses, such as data management, in high school, you can definitely take advantage and saves a lot of study time. Otherwise, remember to go and find the TAs or tutors. Some of them are willing to answer your questions. One more tips is that try to use scientific calculators in your midterms and finals. This is undoubtedly beneficial for answering those questions with redundant arithmetic calculations.

I am suprised that some people think his exams are hard. Yes, the average scores were in the 60's but he posts all the lectures online so if you read them you will do fine. I literally only went to class for the tests and I got a B. The reviewers that complained just didnt try very hard. $T$ does have a sarcastic sense of humor but means no harm.

Mixed feelings. $T$ is clearly passionate about public law but the course was not always well laid out. The textbook was bone-dry, and too much class time was spent discussing Rob Ford. Sure, that's tangentially public law-related, but those hours might have been better spent elsewhere.

Sighs. Honestly, I hated $T$- maybe online teaching just didn't work for the content and type of teaching style this course needs. Not enough technical guidance, just a couple of tutorials and you're expected to teach yourself the bulk of the programs used since the classes largely focus more on design theory. The rubric and marking scheme is rather unfair in my opinion- a high A is only achievable with" award-worthy, industry-ready work", which is a) unfeasible for a 101 course and b) especially unfeasible given the amount of teaching done and the spreading of the deadlines, in which they basically fling projects at you until you somehow are expected to become an Adobe Suite master. Not everyone who goes into this course is proficient in photography or illustration, and no amount of assistance is given to these people to set them on par with the more proficient students, resulting in many being extremely demotivated. Maybe some sort of class separation by skill level would've worked better? Either way, this class honestly made me reconsider my entire decision to take up GBDA :(

Great $T$! While CS136 is about mostly c, this course is much more fun since in addition to the c content, it is all about an introduction to interpreters and compilers. Be prepared to get your hands dirty on many levels of abstraction, from assembly language( s) to high level functional code. This course introduces you to many different ways of thinking, starting off with mutable Racket, then moving into making interpreters and compilers. Overall, a very fun course, definitely recommend.

This is the 2nd class I've had $T$ for and he is NOT a good teacher. He waste a lot of class time setting up things( like still-life).

$T$ were comparatively easier than ME 322. However, the bulk of the final grade for ME 423 is based off one long final project. The project requires submission of three reports, and one final report.

Only choose this course if you want to enter the already over-saturated Product Design job market that requires knowledge of CAD and mechanical design.

The midterm was reasonable, but the final was relatively more difficult. Only choose this course if you want to enter the already over-saturated Product Design job market that requires knowledge of CAD and mechanical design.

I was pleasantly surprised by $T$. It seems to have been changed significantly over the past few years, and is now a better fit for iterative software development methodologies. Assignments are based on collecting and analyzing requirements and specifications for your capstone project, which can be useful. The course covers a width breadth of topics, though the final exam is almost entirely application-based.

The $T$ was fine and easy to understand, and the TA was a very good teacher( not so much Ms. Dong, she was nice but not an engaging professor) but the mini essays were marked arbitrarily and pitted you against your classmates as the TA told us he was specifically marking along a standard deviation/ bell curve.

$T$: Good, light course, especially if you're interested in politics. 3 online quizzes for 25%( 5/10/10), these should be guaranteed 90 + if you're smart about it. 3 1. 5-2 page TED Talk papers for 30%. These are very flexible, as you only have to do one per each of the 3 units, but there are 4 possible topics per unit, each with their own due date week, so you can do them at your own convenience. Also, if you do bad on one, you can do another( provided it's the same unit) and she'll drop the lower mark. 3 3-4 page essays for 45%. The topics she gives as options to write about are pretty self-explanatory and clear, so these weren't hard to write. In terms of marking, I'd say it's really really easy to get 70 + on the TED Talk papers and essays. Decently easy to get low 80s on both of these papers, mid-high 80s you need to do a good job. 90 seems to be the highest mark she gives on them, but if you do really well on the quizzes( which you should) your final mark can be 90s. You'll want the textbook if you're aiming for a really good mark, as about 2-4 questions on a 50 question quiz will say to reference the textbook, but if you don't care about this then textbook not needed.

I LOVED my $T$. She, in my opinion, isn't boring at all, and is extremely open-minded to all types of art. Her classes were fun and engaging, and though the weekly projects took me a LONG time, I got some fabulous artwork out of it. I love her style of reviewing our work and overall commend this woman!

Shes is monotone and easy to be sidetracted in her class. I never read the book and almost failed. $T$ teaches right from the book. If you read the book you will be fine. Also make sure You always go to class. If yoou miss a class you get way behind and miss a lot of material. She is very knowledgable and knows her stuff.

$T$ is absolutely terrible. i wished i had looked her up before. I am a very good writer and she refuses to give me anything over a 70. very hard to please. I don't recommend her to anyone. I spent four hours on an assignment last week and received a 62. She did not like my opinion.

I found the $T$ was just one fact after another, and the way they're laid out in the online version, you're rushing to keep up and struggling not to fall asleep because of the lack of any expression in the voice talking whatsoever. I haven't taken the exam yet but I've received the outline, and I don't think it could possibly be finished in two and a half hours, the amount of essays small and large we have to write plus the random dates, fill in the blanks and information needed... it doesn't seem like a 200 level course at all.

$T$ is very useful, especially if you're in statistics, since you'll be working with large sets of data a lot. Even if you're in other programs, this course has a lot of real-life applications used in many computer-related jobs. However, I found some of the material to be quite dry, especially towards the end of the course. The class average was around 80 with Michael Liu, so it wasn't very difficult at all.

Somewhat of a fun $T$ considering it was calculus. Spent most of the time learning different methods to solve ODE's, so there's a bit of memorization involved. You end up using a few main techniques anyways. The practical examples were a great way to connect the material to real life applications. Lots of work as usual.

Professor was always engaging, however boring the material. Was not hard to pass although there is a lot of reading it is possible to do well without reading the $T$, just show up to class. Be knowledgeable about the reading and you will be fine. Great guy who wants you to do well.

The $T$ was really nice and wanted her students to succeed. I also got lucky and had a great TA so got over 80 before midterm and exam. Relatively easy class to succeed in, study mostly everything required and based on what the prof says and you can do very well in the class.

Do the textbook, end of lecture and practice assignments religiously. Seek assistance from TAs as soon as you need help
Okay guys be warned $T$ is tricky , but also really cool. You'll pretty much learn how to take a group of images of a 3D object( top view, side view, etc), and extrapolate that into the 3D object itself, as well as draw alternate views, all using very specific methods. I'm a very visual thinker, and having done lots of 3D modelling using Google Sketchup( free to download) beforehand, I dealt with this course much easier than many of my classmates. For those who aren't visual thinkers, you will have to bend your mind in strange ways to comprehend the sorcery that is occuring in front of you. Also in this course you learn how to use- a very old and annoying version of - AutoCAD( A 2D and 3D modelling software). If you want to do some pre-study( I recommend it, at least to see what you're getting into) the main thing to take a look at is called" Orthographic diagrams". There are some really cool principles you'll learn about how to draw these, but if you don't get a SOLID understanding of them , it will go from cool to absolute torture and you will probably die.

This is coming from a 1st year undergrad who did ok in high school Physics( even though I hated it). If you think $T$ is disorganized, PHYS111L IS SOMETHING ELSE. I HATE THIS COURSE WITH A PASSION. Firstly, there is barely any background information on what to include on your lab reports, if there is , it is too broad. With that in mind Seeing as I receive a different TA marking my assignments each time, the overall requirements do not even matter when the TAs have there own preferences. The communication of content and ideas related to concepts taught in PHYS 111 is horrendous. Yes I got to conduct cool experiments which I enjoyed but there weren't any set in stone guidelines for what values to include in your lab report. The whole premise behind this course is that it gives you the freedom to examine and improve your experiment but that idea is really just a façade. If you don't like physics do not take this course. If physics is your forte , go for it! The content is just 5 labs but the TAs / instructor barely communicate the proper guidelines as if they want you to fail and retake it again. It only thing I really learned was how to apply physics equations to real life matters which really is not unique or mind blowing in any sense. My last words of advice, if you are planning on taking this course and you are not well rounded in PHYS 111 AVOID at all COUNTS. If you are planning on going to med school, Biomedical sciences at waterloo is great but Biology would be a better choice.( Yes there is physics on the mcat but it is better to review these concepts on your own time rather then risk you own GPA with disorganized courses like these.) I am glad I dropped this course when I did, not worth your time if you don't like the premise, that goes for everything else in life too.

This has got to be the most difficult course after first-year, but perhaps this statement is a bit subjective since I have always struggled with $T$ since IGCSE. Homework problems , and quizzes were extremely difficult since the questions covered were seldom solved in the tutorials , or lectures.

Very fun $T$. You'll learn a lot; not just about defending yourself but feeling confident in yourself, too. Attendance is mandatory. A man will come in for the final to perform an attack on each student and you'll have to properly fight back. It's really easy. Such a great class!

He is amazing and intelligent $T$. He loves to teach and does not mind repeating himself and clarifying topics. He teaches old school and uses the board versus a bunch of power points. He is more than willing to meet before class for extra lecture for those who put in effort. He doesn't spoon feed students but makes anatomy easier to learn.

Very interesting. A broad $T$. While Prof. Curtis can be dry, he totally knows his stuff, having worked in the field. Very interesting to talk to, if you can catch him after class.

A poor $T$ for a very useful topic. Labs were too easy and exams were too difficult." Applications to machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging will be emphasized." No applications were taught. Mathematical derivations are given more emphasis than anything else( therefore algebra). Professor was pretty enthusiastic.

One of my favourite bio courses so far. $T$ was easy and Josh Neufeld is hilarious and a really good prof. There's a decent amount of memorization, not as much as some people made it seem and the content is easy. Not hard to do well if you just memorize the slides. Its a typical bio course that doesnt require much work.

$T$ likes to talk ... a lot. Not about the material, but about random things that don't matter. Several times per class, she starts talking about things that are completely irrelevant to the topic. During lecture on statistical power, she talked for 25 minutes about a software package that she didn't like. ALWAYS has mistakes in quizzes and lecture.

Not an easy course, nor has it served me any use. I went into $T$ looking to learn lots about mechanics and interaction between planets but ended up memorizing 400 pages of random material ranging from particle interaction to chemical composition of atmospheres that I forgot instantly after the exam. Take something a little more interesting or easier.

Bird $T$! Took it with Predrag Rajsic this term( winter 2021 online). Took the review quizzes without reviewing the week's material( since the material is a lot like econ101 but just more in depth) and ended up with a 7/8 out of 10. As for the midterms we had 3 of them. Not very difficult. Studied all the midterm contents 3 days before midterm. Note that the midterm is closed book so you really need to learn in advance in contrast with the review quizzes. This course does not require a lot of work and is a great break from all the other math / cs courses. Definitely recommend taking it with Predrag and listening to the lecture recordings if you can't attend the synchronous class!

$T$ was really helpful since it develops your Management Accounting , Strategy and Finance competencies for CPA( Core 2). Nancy's cases are quite difficult, especially the quants, and she also gives out low participations. This course is almost like AFM482 and AFM211 combined. You'd practice capstone cases too. An equal balance in quants and qualitative analysis will be taught. I thought it was a very useful and challenging course.

Lots of theories and people to remember but very well explained. For $T$ you would have to study really hard and in depth beyond what was written.

I took this course online in F21 with Vinh Nguyen. Course breakdown was: participation( 25%), 2 short responses( 15% each), proposal for project( 10%), creative project( 35%). There are $T$ each week; I didn't do most of them and still got by pretty well( likely because it was online). The course content is very interesting and relevant. If you're Asian , you might even be able to relate to a lot of the topics that are discussed.

The $T$ was quite simple. The quizzes were openbook and weren't very hard, as long as you went through the course material. The two assignments took a bit of time to complete but as long as you put time aside to complete them, you should be perfectly fine.

$T$ is fairly easy, definitely go to class if you have Merrin, her midterms are 30% each but are really easy if you actually study; with that said you should be spending at least 2-3 days before the midterm understanding all the concepts; memorization is not key here, you really need to understand the information to do well

$T$ literally does not explain anything. She tells you what sites are " helpful ", but they really aren't. She does reply to emails even though it is an online course.

I needed it for my minor, so I considered it useful. SO SO SO interesting and amazing!! Would recommend to everyone. This was my first $T$ ever and I was super nervous about that, but it honestly does not feel like 3 hours at all. He sort of gauges the class before determining how much discussion vs teaching he's going to do, which is really nice. When I took the course, there were 2 papers, iClickers( 15% participation!!) and a final( which was your choice of a test or another essay). You also get a ton of feedback on the essays so there's a lot of opportunity for improvement as the term progresses.

I said I didn't speak Mandarin but I know very few basic characters( I, you, him, etc.) and they put me in this course. I had people speaking fluent canto, or there were some people who could speak but not read, or read but not speak.
$T$ is a great ASL teacher and cares that you actually know how to communicate instead of just knowing vocab. I liked her class because she didn't just sign at us the whole time, we got to act out things and mess up and get better. She's so respectful and fun. If you don't make an effort your grade might suffer.

$T$ was challenging because the instructor was not able to express the materials clearly. Not to mention, he does not speak fluent English.

Definitely a $T$ that shouldn't be taken lightly, as the content is very important for mechs. Some of the content is dry and includes a lot of memorization , but will be important later on. Read the course textbook!

Tom's is a brilliant $T$, always willing to help you learn. I'm a visual/ spatial learner and found his instructions clear. Yes, his classes are hard perhaps more so for those who are not keen on doing problems. But as long as you do the attend the lectures, homework, ask questions, and think you will get a decent grade.

Only 2 full lab reports. Online $T$ are very short on time. Find the in-lab questions they ask you on LEARN. No exam. The instructor literally never shows up, so your experience with this course will be highly TA-dependent. Personally, I found the lab reports a bit tedious, but all of the coursework is basically those and the pre-lab quizzes. Pretty easy to get 90 + overall.

PROS:( 1) $T$ itself were simple to understand.( 2) Nicely arranged content on Learn and Mobius( I took it online).( 3) Decent grade , task , and submission period distribution. CONS:( 1) Too many readings for a first-time learner of econ.( 2) One collective zoom office hour( 1 hour long) at the beginning of the week felt very unfair( 3) Found a need for more OHs each week and a MS teams GC.( 4) Felt isolated from the rest of the class.( 5) lack of one-to-one instructional support( unless you email every question).( 6) Had to refer to external resources for quicker understanding because readings were too time consuming.( 7) Weren't taught at all on how to approach an article / case study. TIPS:( 1) Finish all readings in the first two days of the week,( 2) repeat quizzes till you get them correct( you get 4 chances per graded quiz every week, please use these well).( 3) Don’t just read to study, answer a lot of MCQs.

Matthew Harris- We all love him $T$. If you have him as a professor, then find Jesus - you'll need him. His handwriting is less legible than that of a grade schooler's, and he teaches like we're math students.

Though I think she has a genuine interest in working with her students, she is blinded by her own opinions and preferences. The $T$ is an exercise in figuring out what SHE likes, and if you don't do( or can't figure out) what she wants, your grade will reflect it!\ r She plays favorites, and I didn't think her" favorite" was talented.

Excellent $T$, I spent about 1-2 hours a week on it and finished with a high grade. You were required to buy an e-textbook with embedded quizzes in it, but the quizzes are so easy , it's practically common sense. No final. I took this course in Winter 2021, so it might've changed(?).

$T$ isn't all that useful for software engineering, and all of the content turned out to be pure memorization. Overall, 222 ended up being really disappointing- it was disorganized and most of the time no one knows what's going. Fortunately, the professor we had gave out trivia questions on his exams so we ended up with a decent mark.

The course is moral issues from the perspective of Libertarianism; for example, Narveson argues that global warming doesn't exist to justify his views.

$T$ isn't difficult but you have to do your readings and work in order to succeed. I found the topics covered in class really interesting. If you show and participate you'll end up in the 70s for sure but if you put in the extra effort you can definitely get 80s and above. This is honestly one of those classes where you get back what you put into it. Actually try and you'll learn a lot plus get a decent grade. Would definitely recommend for SPCOM students especially if you're in the intercultural stream

Just a disclaimer: I took $T$ in Spring 2021 with Ashwin Nayak, Chelweon Heo, Olya Mandelshtam and Jorn Van Der Pol- pray you never have to go through what my term-mates and I had to. This was easily and by far the absolute worst course I have ever taken at Waterloo, with the worst professors I ever had the displeasure of interacting with. The words arrogant , cold , and ignorant come to mind when I recall interacting with the professors for the most basic help during Office Hours, which were the only time we could contact these people as they abandoned Piazza for the first half of the course, only returning once half the class failed their" test", which was essentially a midterm on steroids- 1 hour for three very difficult questions unlike anything we'd ever seen in the lectures( which they didn't make), course notes( not them either), assignments, or practice problems in terms of difficulty and style. Extremely harsh marking with absolutely no mercy. We were all basically teaching ourselves this entire course, which in a regular term is difficult enough, only to be thrown curve balls at every opportunity by the professors and teaching staff. Never have I felt such a passionate disdain for such a course in Waterloo or school in general. I've had previous anxiety problems resurface because of the gross negligence of the professors who taught this course- do avoid them at all costs. TLDR: Arrogant , neglectful professors+ have to teach yourself the entire course from pre-recorded , barebones lectures+ insanely hard tests with terrible marking distributions+ extremely harsh marking= a very , very bad time in Spring 2021.

The words arrogant , cold , and ignorant come to mind when I recall interacting with the professors for the most basic help during Office Hours, which were the only time we could contact these people as they abandoned Piazza for the first half of the course, only returning once half the class failed their" test", which was essentially a midterm on steroids- 1 hour for three very difficult questions unlike anything we'd ever seen in the lectures( which they didn't make), course notes( not them either), assignments, or practice problems in terms of $T$. Extremely harsh marking with absolutely no mercy. We were all basically teaching ourselves this entire course, which in a regular term is difficult enough, only to be thrown curve balls at every opportunity by the professors and teaching staff. Never have I felt such a passionate disdain for such a course in Waterloo or school in general. I've had previous anxiety problems resurface because of the gross negligence of the professors who taught this course- do avoid them at all costs. TLDR: Arrogant , neglectful professors+ have to teach yourself the entire course from pre-recorded , barebones lectures+ insanely hard tests with terrible marking distributions+ extremely harsh marking= a very , very bad time in Spring 2021.

This $T$ is very interesting and useful for exam MLC. It provides a very useful link to life insurance concepts. However, if you do not practice, even if you think you know the material well, you will not do well in the course. I feel like I understood the course material quite well, but I barely passed the course because I did not practice enough to be able to do problems quickly and efficiently- time constraint was a big problem for me on exams. Make sure you spend a lot of time on this course outside of class, if you want to do well in it.

This course has three big $T$( where most of your marks come from, some of these are in groups), and three smaller minute-long practice speech exercises. This course is clearly good at what it sets out to do- I saw classmates go from 4 minutes-over time, rambling speeches at the start of term, to concise and to-the-point speeches with clear purpose by the end of term. Would absolutely recommend this course if you're looking to get better at speeches, because you will. Don't skip any lectures though- class participation is usually a big part of lectures, and being part of the audience is important for when others are making speeches. Also keep on top of required readings- you don't want to be clueless when your professor asks for your thoughts on the article you were supposed to have read.

Class was a mess. Her lectures talked in circles. I didn't learn anything( nothing!) during the whole $T$. She also has a bad habit of interrupting oral presentations with irrelavent questions and/ or turning your presentation into HER presentation. Class was easy, but not worth the aggrevation.

$T$ is a fun language that anyone can grasp quickly. Professor Kim's lectures are always a blast and the homework assignments are very helpful for learning the vocabulary and grammar rules. Looking forward to Korea 102!

The University of Exeter has excellent $T$. Had my course been less time-consuming, I would have taken the opportunity to do more sport and societies. The only two things I found to be problematic were: 1. The student services team is slow, probably because they are understaffed, but also because their processes are poorly thought through. I expected a higher standard from a Russell Group university in this regard; having studied at undergraduate level with a non-Russell Group university, I was surprised when these processes were not nearly as good as my former university. 2. Student loans are released termly by Student Finance England. However, the University of Exeter seem to think it is reasonable to expect their tuition fee payments to come in per semester; so in two instalments, rather than the three they come in. As such, you have to apply to Student Services to get this changed; it just seems nonsensical. Overall, I enjoyed my time studying at the University of Exeter.

$T$ is always intimidating, but the people you work with soon become like family! I have learnt very useful public speaking skills to apply to other aspects of my life/ courses. Especially important is the lesson you learn regarding how to structure a good speech. The design of a speech- not the delivery- is what is emphasized in this course. If you need an elective, but are not sure what to take, take this one. You do 3 speeches: informative, persuasive and entertaining.

Personally, I found $T$ to be easier than PHYS 364. Though 364 is not a prerequisite, Phys 365 is a nice continuation of Math Phys. 1. The content of the course is divided into 3 sections: Probability and Statistics, Integral Transforms( Fourier and Laplace), and Complex Variable Theory( computing integrals using complex variables and line integrals, Cauchy's principal value, etc.). Assignments are a nice continuation of the material covered in lecture, and are worth a sizeable portion of the final grade. It is easy to do well on them, and the questions on the midterm and final are very similar or identical, so invest your time in them. A highly recommended course to further develop your mathematical maturity with a backdrop of physics concepts.

$T$ has only 4 tests at 14% each and one paper worth 40%+ bonus 4% at the end. Honestly the quizzes every couple weeks are harder than you'd think but as long as you study for an hour or so every week you will do fine. No recorded content, all just modules + readings.

Okay $T$, but do not expect to pass if you miss a couple of classes. I missed a bit of classes due to personal issues and ended up losing 15% of my grade. The fact that she did not accommodate or even slightly try to really bothered me. She basically said" there's nothing I can do" Lectures are long and must listen to pass. Exams are hard.

$T$ is an awesome teacher. I used to have her back in high school, we didn't get along. So I decided to take her at Mission College, I ended up loving her class. If you need help she's there, she's understanding, and she's an awesome comedian at times when she cracks jokes about a student. Study, and you'll pass the class. Good Luck.

This is one of the most useless courses you will ever take in AFM. You learn little of every aspect of business, such as marketing, accounting, HRM, and so on. The $T$ are bs, everyone just copies from each other and leave after the clickers. Boring lectures. What's worse is that this course is largely depended on your TA. If you have really easy TAs then you can easily get a good mark. If not, your discussion board marks as well as your final report marks will be ruined and you will end up with a low mark.

$T$ is tough and you really have to know your stuff in order to succeed. The tests are very fair and Dr. Dupont doesn't try to trick you or anything, but she expects a significant amount of detail for full marks and the tests are extremely long. On both the midterm and the final, I ran out of time and couldn't finish all the questions. Make sure you keep up with the lectures or the tutorials will be rough and try to keep reviewing throughout the term because you'll thank yourself when you start studying for the exam.

$T$ was badly evaluated, with annoying, linear( can't go back to previous questions), select-all-that-apply Mobius quizzes testing our knowledge on weird edge cases of formal definitions( which is a method of deflating high avgs caused by cheaters, but really hurts the non-cheaters ' grades). However, the Crowdmark written assignments were pretty straightforward, and office hours were helpful in clarifying concepts/ questions. Despite all this, I liked 137 content a lot after understanding the concept behind epsilon-delta proofs and how to do them( absolutely essential!). The midterm was tougher than usual- or so I've heard- with 60s averages compared to 70s, but I believe 60s and 70s averages are normal for the majority of university courses.

Despite all this, I liked 137 content a lot after understanding the concept behind epsilon-delta proofs and how to do them( absolutely essential!). The $T$ was tougher than usual- or so I've heard- with 60s averages compared to 70s, but I believe 60s and 70s averages are normal for the majority of university courses.

The comments are true- $T$ is an amazing prof!! Definitely grew an appreciation for movie music after taking this course; had no idea music could have such a huge impact on every aspect of movies before. Course was made up of 4 non-cumulative tests. Took it online with pre-recorded lectures posted weekly. Even my friends/ family who weren't taking the course enjoyed listening to his lectures, with many describing it as a podcast! Definitely recommend!!

$T$ was actually ok( i normally hate group work). It was very clear what was expected of us and the course followed what was outlined at the beginning very well. the content was enjoyable and interesting. The tests were fair and fairly easy given that they were open book, but i bet all the information would have made in-person , closed-book tests challenging.

I took this class with $T$. What an awesome prof! I HATED lin alg in M136 but he proved me wrong. I absolutely loved him and this course. Even though it was online, it's extremely well organized.( three PDFs for notes, exercises, and practice problem answers) We had three fcs( 5 mobius questions)+ mobius+ crowdmark assignments each week so it is certainly a heavy course, but if you survive from it- you will have a great understanding of the subject.

I love $T$. The perfect mix of fun , societies and clubs with a really high level education. I study business and french and have found the lecturers are seminar leaders to be mostly very helpful and attentive. Unlike a lot of universities, as a campus university it is so easy to socialise and make friends as everyone is on campus. I only have one online lecture a week which is incredible in comparison to my friends in bigger unis like Leeds or Bristol who have barely met their course mates as their lectures are almost entirely online. It is such a sociable uni and so easy to meet lots of people, and the stereotypes of people in Exeter are mostly untrue in my opinion. There are a lot of Surrey people here tho. I initially thought that the campus being further away from city would be an issue, but it is literally a ten minute walk. Unlike most other unis, all the main first year acoms are less than a fifteen min walk from campus and the same distance from town.

The $T$ was interesting but poorly presented. Each class literally defined each mental illnesses, it's cause/ origin, diagnosis and treatment. 50% midterm and 50% final. 3hr night course was very long & boring. Course was taken in 2017 winter.

Covers a lot of $T$, but it's not too difficult to get a good mark as long as you study and do a lot of practice questions before the midterm/ final.

All you need to do is show up and somewhat listen. $T$ is very lecture heavy( explaining tests, quizzes, powerpoints) and doesn't stop until the end of class. The big part about getting a good grade with this professor is just turning stuff in and studying for tests, participation doesn't really seem to matter.

$T$ is the best professor I have EVER had. Took his 3-week interim course for 221, and when it was over I actually missed going to class. He is everything you could ever ask in a teacher. Just listen to his lectures and PARTICIPATE. Ask questions, he answers them clearly and then some. He made me realize that I am definitely in the right major.

I hated $T$. There's not really any homework. Just outlines& exams. He does listening exams that are kinda hard. You have to learn the names of foreign songs and where they're from. Hard to learn the names. The outlines are long papers you have to type up. Instrument ID's and cultural questions. Not a fun class. And an essay.

Pretty good $T$. You have to do reading evaluations but profs usually don't read them. 3 major speeches and 3 minor speeches. You don't get a lot of practice which is disappointing. With my prof, it was easy to get a 75 but hard to get above 85. Overall, not too work intensive.

Important to have this $T$ and I liked the course despite some of the lectures being pretty boring. I heard that previous offerings had problem sets that were more proof-based and mathematical than ours- we just had 2 labs with( pretty tedious) programming of a few simulations in our choice of language, and 1 lab that was explaining packets and basic networking tools. Exams were straightforward with questions that were predictable if you went to lectures and tutorials.

Was taught the course by the extremely passionate $T$ who helped immensely in understanding the quite difficult readings for the course. Although the course is extremely reading-heavy, the assessments( only 3 essays for the whole course, no final) allowed for extreme choice in what you'll be writing about. Since you can see the choices ahead of time, you can basically just only read about what your essay will be on, and skip everything else.

The course content is essentially reading the entire textbook and then having quizzes based on the chapters. On top of that was a $T$ that was 40% of our grade but only 1250 words( including the references page?!?!?!) which to me was honestly kind of absurd. Overall the content in the textbook is somewhat interesting.

This $T$ is a lot of fun. She's so funny! BUT there is A LOT of material to cover& she moves FAST. You can't screw off.

Highly prof-dependent $T$, especially since the intention is to have some" current topics" in software engineering post-midterm which can be whatever each prof feels like including. However, expect common topics like GoF OOP design patterns( extending CS247) and standard architectural styles as well as some definitions and simple concepts related to architecture and design. We also had some OOP type theory( generics, variance) and static analysis( software testing tools and annotation type frameworks like the Checker Framework). Dietl changed the course to not have a major software project because SE 390 already has some. Instead, we had a design assignment , architecture assignment , and reading assignment( reading+ summarizing software papers) each worth 10%, and they were great for exposing us to real-world , practical architectures. Midterm and final are fair, especially if you attended class. Tutorials were completely empty and useless; do not go unless you have specific questions to ask the TAs or know for sure that they have content prepared to go over( or you just want to get other work done in a room that's booked for 50 min). Lectures were good, and promoted collaborative learning.

Instead, we had a design assignment , architecture assignment , and reading assignment( reading+ summarizing software papers) each worth 10%, and they were great for exposing us to real-world , practical architectures. Midterm and final are fair, especially if you attended class. Tutorials were completely empty and useless; do not go unless you have specific questions to ask the TAs or know for sure that they have content prepared to go over( or you just want to get other work done in a room that's booked for 50 min). $T$ were good, and promoted collaborative learning.

A Grade 10 / 11 algebra $T$. Not difficult at all, mostly just a refresher for students already familiar with algebra. If you are a beginner to algebra the content starts from the very beginning, so definitely a good course for students who didn't take maths in secondary school.

Oh goodness, this man is a teddy bear that loves English with a passion( but don't hug $T$... that's weird)! I'm not a fan of English, but I'm enjoying his class so much. It's fun with not a lot of work. If you can take his class, do it. Yeah, it can be a little boring, but we always end up having fun. Oh, and participate in discussions!!

Do not recommend $T$ at all. I am usually an A/ B student but his online class is atrocious. Assignments are due on Sunday night which threw me off& his quizzes are insanely hard. Even if you read the section( sometimes 50 pages)& take notes they're still hard. He words them just so that any answer could be right. Don't waste your time.

A tough $T$ that covers way beyond what is expected in CS 136. Course content includes everything from basic C syntax and all the typical CS 136 content to racket interpreters, assemblers, compilers, MMIX assembly, hoare logic, monads, trampolining, etc. There's mandatory tutorials which act as additional lecture time, the lectures are very fast paced( seems to sort of skim over important details sometimes), and the assignments became quite challenging at the end. It's an advanced course, so that's what you're signing up for. It was definitely my hardest course of the term, but it was very educational , eye-opening, and quickly exposed me to many CS topics. Profs were fantastic.

I found the $T$ to cover the basic information and theories discussed in the textbook. I do believe it would have been more beneficial if we were able to discuss theories more in-depth, to gain a better grasp of the material, but there was so much information to cover that there wasn't enough allotted time for class discussion. The course was pretty cut and dry: theories and real-life examples of such. The topics were interesting but what added to the interest of the topic was an engaging professor.

Although $T$ explains herself in a way that may be entertaining & easy to remember / comprehend, I felt that she was too easy.

This was one of the worst courses I've taken at university. I can see how some of the other' annoying' courses in SE are useful for us. However, $T$ has, if anything, deterred our FYDP group progress. After five co-op terms, I can safely say that I've never seen the course material being used in industry. If we were being taught about outdated project management practices so that we're aware of them, we shouldn't be asked to use it on our core FYDP group- there should be a dummy project created instead.

There is a great range of societies on offer and there is a very friendly atmosphere on campus. Lectures are excellent and some of the staff are internationally renowned experts in their field( I study Law). My only wish would be for a more diverse student body.

Bird $T$! This course was relatively interesting and very easy to do well in. If you actually put effort into the readings and assignments its an easy 95. Definitely recommend taking for anyone who gas some basic knowledge in biology and is looking for a fun easy course!

$T$ is extremely boring and talks a lot off topic. He doesn't answer his emails so don't even bother there. I'm in his class right now and its incredibly boring, I wish I'd taken an online class. You have to do A LOT of reading in the book- They say I say, and the readings are really long.. So far I wouldn't recommend him.

I've always heard great things from $T$, but this term it's been really poor and difficult to get through. Expectations for assignments are not laid out whatsoever, so everyone is in shock when they receive feedback. Deliverables are extremely vague.

I also don't feel like I've learned much from this course, but I feel like I would have in a classroom environment.

MATH 227 is the science faculty's course that introduces multivariate calculus and vector calculus. The $T$ such as double/ triple integration in polar/ cylindrical/ spherical coordinates prove to be very useful for later courses, so try to pick up on those! Vector calculus is very important for electromagnetism as well if you wish to take that. This course may be more time consuming and challenging than your other calculus courses so don't feel too bad if you don't get it right away!

midterm and final
Neutral
Overall, a $T$ with interesting content but very badly run. The review below sum it up well, trash mobius quizzes with select all the apply, no part marks and a linear format. However, the crowdmark assignments were quite doable. My main issue with this course was the lacking of teaching and/ or practice material. Unlike M135, we had almost no practice before doing a Mobius Quiz, which explains why so many people did bad. Oh, MANY people did poorly on the midterm, a combination of first year reality plus horrible teaching. Some of us felt as if the instructors spent more time making some impossible test questions rather than teaching us. Sometimes, even the Prof at office hours would get one of the options incorrect being confused by certain absurd questions. Thankfully I had learned most of this material in high school, so I somehow finished with a mark in the low 90's. AVOID THIS COURSE ONLINE!

$T$ is one of the best professors you could ever ask for! Honestly, you could not ask for a better amazing professor than her, she is one of the best. She cares so much for each and everyone of her students, she is really the one to take. Her class is tough, but she gives tons of feedback so you know what to fix and complete for next time.

If you're scared about $T$, don't worry! The design allows people who have never coded , like me , to learn and be confident that they know what they are learning. Start assignments on time and don't half-ass them! It's ok to get 50 on a couple, but it adds up! The assignments are where you're actually gonna understand the material but lectures are important for providing you with a basic understanding. When it comes to exams, the best thing to do is practice!

I don't know what was going on this term... Until halfway across the term, the $T$ weren't on Piazza. The format of the course seems to have been reworked completely from previous online offerings( for no good reason, since previous offerings were apparently great). There were a lot more timed tests. Presumably to stop cheating, but I would guess it would help cheaters who were able to get a question paper beforehand, because if you had seen the questions before the super-strict time limits might seem a lot more reasonable. Even profs had trouble solving practice problems in office hours. The lectures were all old and reused from previous terms, which were great. I really enjoyed the content. But the assessments- especially the timed exams- were so stressful and draining that I came away disliking the course despite being interested in the topics.

$T$ was excellent! I like psychology so this was relatively fun, but it really wasted a big chunk of my school time to get there in the evening and sit through the lectures.( I LOVE online classes) The prof really explained things well, he was approachable , understanding , and kind. He extended due dates and was very accomodating, which helped so many of us. Richard Ebach is his name( may have spelled it wrong, sorry!) Downside: group work. does it ever end well? eh , unavoidable anyway. I don't think I'd ever use this in my future career though, but who knows.

You learn a lot of very interesting and useful $T$ in this course. Loved the problem-centric + discovery style delivery of the content, made it that much more engaging and definitely helped me learn. Assignments were quite long but very rewarding- beware there's no release tests so you'll have to write your own tests! Final project was AGE game engine, which was very fun but also incredibly super big and long- most people I talked to didn't do very well on the final project( myself included), but still loved the course.

$T$ is very useful for any STAT-related job, as well as almost all 4th-year STAT courses. The material isn't TOO difficult. The proofs are not like the ones in MATH 235 in that you can just understand them( or even memorize, if you will) and then reproduce them, since you won't have to derive anything abstract on your own that you haven't seen before like you probably did in MATH 235.

I took Matt's Voice and Diction+ his acting 4 the camera and both are exceptional. $T$ force you to better your performance in front of the entire class which is horrifying at first but is the best practice for taking a directors feedback on set. Come to sessions prepared or you'll just waste chances to better yourself as an actor.

Really enjoyed $T$. She loves the subject which made it very easy for me to stay interested. Yes she goes fast, and gets short when students ask the same question over and over, but it was frustrating for those of us who didn't need multiple reiterations. She is very demanding , but fair.

The $T$ was extremely boring and a complete waste of time. I think most sections of this course were organized well, but some profs like to teach their own way, and that could make the organization a nightmare. Fairly easy, but the essays take a couple of hours even if you're speedrunning. If you like writing then you might enjoy the class somewhat, but you definitely won't learn anything meaningful. If you're taking this as a communication course in the Math faculty then you most likely would benefit more from taking an SPCOM class instead of this one, even if the SPCOM classes are borderline useless as well.

Well-formatted as an online $T$; modules contained most of the information needed for assignments though some topics were only discussed at a surface level. Grade breakdown was very generous: 5% popups, 22% quizzes( with unlimited attempts), 53% assignments( 4 total), and 20% take-home final. Assignments were not difficult after going through the modules and making sure to understand the examples, though there seemed to be a lot more writing than programming. I found the logic and proof methods taught in MATH 135 to be useful here.

The $T$ itself is literally just writing. You don't learn very much and the work is tedious. Now is it an easy course? Well yes, you don't do that much. However, that can be a con if your TA is like mine and literally took months to mark my assignments. For the longest time, I had 0/ 20 for my unit activities and she marked 3 of my assignments. I didn't know my progress in the course until the very end when 9-11 things were marked. How am I supposed to use my feedback? how do I know what I need to work on? As you can probably tell by this comment I'm still not a very good writer and I finished the course with a high 80. Waste of time and not an enjoyable course.

Fun course with really interesting labs. The lectures online were generally pretty stiff and dull, in person they are really good. Wish there were more assignments that could actually be used for practice vs the current scenario of basically no $T$ beyond midterm/ final/ labs.

You need a solid understanding of basic probability, expectation, conditional probability, and probability distributions for this course. Almost everything builds on $T$. The core content involves Markov chains, Poisson processes, and conditional probably and expectation of multiple variables.

He's such a great $T$! He is the Chief of Police in SB and he has tons of stories that are related to what we learn. It was really helpful to have that advantage when learning. He's not intimidating which is what I thought it would be like but he's super relaxed. Attendance is nessicary beacause of the quizzes.

$T$ is great! He's truly passionate about math. I LOVED his class, he made 75 minutes fly by( although I usually hate math). Only issue is that he sometimes moved too fast, but overall he was very clear and helpful. Doesn't just want his students to memorize steps but to understand the material. Gives credit where it's deserved.

Absolutely waste of time. Plus if you have $T$ as your prof, its simply a disaster. A course that will waste a lot of your time and will make you nothing but extremely upset.

I loved the audio comments on all your papers VERY HELPFUL. The guy has a lot of real world experience which helps in class explaining things. Go to $T$!

I felt that the $T$ was useless. A lot of the information was basic and things that you should have learned in HLTH 101, HLTH 202, and HLTH 245. The same with the readings. The readings were very dry but are important for the midterm and exam. The assignments I felt were pointless especially the Health Policy assignment.

$T$ was interesting but only take it if you really want to learn ASL. After this semester I feel that it was a waste of my time because I was not fully interested. The class is taught only in ASL, no talking is allowed!!

Exeter is a great $T$ I feel it offers the full university experience: good range of challenging courses, many societies for almost anything you can think of, good campus facilities e. t. c The only issues I have had have been with timetabling consistently each term giving me classes that overlap. Considering the amount we pay I would at least like to be able to attend my classes! Though this is more an issue with the people in timetabling rather than the university itself I thought it worth mentioning. Other than that I have had an excellent time at Exeter and really engaged with some wonderful classes and lecturers.

Yes, this is truly a terribly run $T$ that is made much more difficult than it should be. I came out with a decent mark but this was a course that i dreaded being apart of. Firstly, the background information given is vague and can be confusing. The theory is easy because you learn this in the PHYS 111 lecture but everything else is difficult because you are given so little information about the lab. They also expect you to know how to calculate certain uncertainties but don't actually teach you how, they just give you a long pdf that is hard to understand if you've never calculated uncertainties before. And the TAs... Some are decent, others are completely useless and might as well not show up. What was even more shocking to me is that he had some TAs that couldn't speak english properly / communicate effectively in english. Considering this is a school that teaches courses in english, I found that extremely inappropriate. How is a TA supposed to help students when they can't communicate with them properly?... Other than that, a lot the TAs were condescending and had an attitude. A lot of them clearly did not want to be there and were not interested in taking the time to help students. Overall, do not take this lab unless it is a required course. And if you absolutely have to take this course, mentally prepare yourself for one of the worst courses you will take in first year. Prepare well before the lab, ask lots of questions, and don't do your lab reports last second. Also, don't let the TAs intimidate you or make you feel stupid for not understanding something! I will not be tolerating their sh * t anymore once I start PHYS 112L. Confront them if you have to.

They also expect you to know $T$ but don't actually teach you how, they just give you a long pdf that is hard to understand if you've never calculated uncertainties before. And the TAs... Some are decent, others are completely useless and might as well not show up. What was even more shocking to me is that he had some TAs that couldn't speak english properly / communicate effectively in english. Considering this is a school that teaches courses in english, I found that extremely inappropriate. How is a TA supposed to help students when they can't communicate with them properly?... Other than that, a lot the TAs were condescending and had an attitude. A lot of them clearly did not want to be there and were not interested in taking the time to help students. Overall, do not take this lab unless it is a required course. And if you absolutely have to take this course, mentally prepare yourself for one of the worst courses you will take in first year. Prepare well before the lab, ask lots of questions, and don't do your lab reports last second. Also, don't let the TAs intimidate you or make you feel stupid for not understanding something! I will not be tolerating their sh * t anymore once I start PHYS 112L. Confront them if you have to.

Expect to spend around 2 hours/ week on the prelabs, and anywhere between 2-4 hours on the weekly labs themselves. While not hard, $T$ combines two former courses and covers a lot. The final was not focused on memorizing algorithms , but entirely on walking you through the creation of new algorithms ( entirely matlab coding ).

A very chill $T$. The content was very easy but maybe that's what made it not very interesting. Had this course with Shannon Hartling and could tell that she very much enjoyed teaching this course. She partnered us up with a classmate and we had to meet a couple of times throughout the term to talk about a specific topic( based on lectures). Then we would have to write a journal entry on how that interaction went. Also had a final presentation at the end and a couple of quizzes where we were tested on terms found in the readings. Readings are relatively easy.

$T$ is one of those subjects which you need to be patient with at first. It will seem like what you're doing has no use and is very difficult to intuitively grasp.

The $T$ itself was pretty simple. Tutorial assignments and then a midterm and final. Leatherdale is by far one of the best profs. Lectures are interesting and easy to relate to. Make sure to highlight what he says will be on the exams in your notes!!! The only downside is that your mark will really depend on the TA you have. Some of them mark a lot harshly than others. If you don’t do well on your first assignment make sure to ask for specific feedback and clarifications of future ones so you don’t lose any marks since each is only worth out of 10.

It's like BIO 130 but with a focus on genetic. It's a lot of information jammed into one $T$ and can be hard to pick up and understand from just listening to the lecture. The midterm is really similar to the practice midterm. Midterm and final exam I found were difficult. The questions were often very specific or just overall questions I wasn't expecting. The tutorial is a good mark booster and similar calculations from it are seen on the final exam.

The hard part for this class is the $T$. So many pages to read each week and the reading notes grading are really arbitrary.

$T$ is one of the most excitable professors to learn from; everything he teaches, even if it's eye-rolling-ly dry, he is absolutely thrilled to teach it anyway and get the class as involved as possible to make things a little more fun. Extremely lovable no matter how hard you try and hate him, probably too sweet and understanding for his own good

This was probably my favourite $T$ I've taken at Waterloo so far( 3rd year Software). I've always been interested in astronomy, so the material was very interesting to me. Assignments were easy relative to engineering courses such as PHYS 115, and exams are mostly just memorization. Using memory tricks like weaving details into a story and the method of loci, got 49/50 on the midterm by just spending, on average, 1 minute per slide the night before.

One of the most interesting courses I have ever taken. $T$ is only a mathematical maturity prerequisite as there is very little linear algebra in this course. Nearly everything from this course is built from the ground up. Each topic in this course is completely interrelated with every other topic throughout the course. The only" applications" in the course were applying Burnside's lemma to counting problems. Would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in abstract algebra regardless of their faculty.

Communicates concepts well and was happy with the $T$ and lecture packets. Tests are hard, do not underestimate them. She is a great teacher but can often pile on work. Stay on top of things and follow the detailed syllabus. I reached out to her multiple times and she solved my problems , no hassle.

The reason so many people rated her low is because they expect easy A's. $T$ made me work for my grade and I walked away actually learning something. One of the most hardest, well deserved , rewarding class I have ever taken. I'd recommend for anyone. She will make me a better nurse!

Taken Online: This was my first real introduction to a programming class as $T$ were basically a joke. Functional programming can be very cool, being forced to understand what's going on under the hood by using Racket will definitely make anyone who takes it a better programmer. Once you get the hang of Racket and are able to adjust your mind this class becomes very passable due to the grading structure. What I didn't like was the multipart questions where you get to h) and you don't even know what the questions asking. The profs did a great job transferring it to online, was my favorite class of 1A, shoutout Becker.

The course compares Advanced economies as three major groups, Anglo-Saxon countries/ Scandinavian countries and Continental Europeans. You will learn about the key economic factors and the differences between these groups of countries and how these changes came about. $T$ is an amazing prof as he requires no textbook, made an animated textbook himself, and everything he taught was laid out in such a way that's very logical and easy to follow. You get 20% from participation and 40% each from 2 very straightforward midterms that has 5 questions each, which are open book. As long as you actually followed through with the weekly lessons, you can not screw these up. Truly not to brag but to prove a point, I ended up with 95 in this course, which previously I thought was impossible for a PSCI course. The average for the class was 78.

Quite literally the worst $T$ that I have taken throughout my undergraduate career thus far. The content itself was very interesting, but the way the course was structured and organized was absolutely ridiculous. For instance, lectures were ALWAYS uploaded 2-3 days late. At one point they were even uploaded a week late. Completely unacceptable. Perlman does not accept late work( exception being the 3 slip days), so I do not see why he cannot be on top of his game. Not to mention that a majority of his lectures are YouTube videos and lectures from other profs at UW. The readings themselves have no correlation whatsoever to the lectures. The content from the reading is so different, and it makes preparing for tests extremely difficult. The tests( 3 worth 20% each), tested students on random facts from the readings which I found unfair. If you take this course, be prepared to deal with a LOT of BS. This course is pure memorization and nothing else.

$T$ is an AMAZING professor! She makes sure you understand the material and cares about your grade to help you pass. I got over 100% in her class, and I am usually one to fail math courses. Very approachable, and HIGHLY recommended. Very funny, too!

There was definitely a lot of $T$ in this class, but it is all very interesting. I enjoyed this class very much, and Prof. Reisman had good insights. She helped me to read more analytically into the text, and encouraged input from the class. Do the work, and you will get a good grade.

$T$ is good at what he does, don't get me wrong. But it feels like we actually " learn " at the end of class( the last 10 minutes or so) feeling a bit rushed. Homework can be a bit overwhelming at times too, considering the pre-req classes leading up to this have about half the amount of work. Sometimes a bit too critical with students/ views too.

This university seriously needs to pay for $T$ to and from town for students. D bus is unreliable and is often slowed down by non uni passengers making people late for lectures. More shelters outside when raining would also be useful. Sports facilities need to be cheaper given the price of the fees we pay to study at university, and would certainly encourage students to take on healthier lifestyle. There needs to be more dedicated study spaces and less ' deliberately ' overpriced on campus food that milks students.

$T$ is absolutely one of the most Hilarious teachers I have taken a course with.

Not even a week into $T$ and I want to drop out. Modules are super dry and they basically consist of long youtube videos and random articles on the internet. Why am I paying this much if I can get this all for free ? Textbook readings are also very long and makes my eyes hurt cause all the text is compacted together. Also the first quiz I took asked very specific questions which I was not a fan of. Only recommend taking this course if you are into religion.

Probably the single worst $T$ in the entire math faculty. It is more like an engineering / physic course, which happens to uses a lot of math as tools, but in the core is unrelated to mathematics. There is not any connection between things taught in the course that could deepen your understanding of mathematics. Should just throw it out from the graduate requirement for math students in general and make it an elective for whoever wants to take it.

But once you get past your frustrations with the $T$, you might end up seeing the beauty and elegance in those succinct equations Maxwell came up with all those years ago that perfectly describe a major part of our reality.

This is a bit of a bird $T$, at least it was the term I took it. It was nice because my other courses were pretty heavy, and this ended up being one I could afford to skip lectures for and put assignments off to the last minute and still perform very well. The content was a bit dry, but useful stuff, whether you're planning on developing desktop apps or web apps. I don't know if the content was cutting edge, but it was more up to date than my own UI / web dev knowledge from the early 2000s.

This course covered a significant amount of $T$, a siginificant portion of which was rushed in the last few weeks of the semester. It is definitely possible to succeed in this course if you keep up with the material and review the practice questions in the textbook. The mid-term exams are very time crunched with only 50 minutes to complete 16 questions, however, sufficient time was provided to complete each of the questions on the final exam.

Hot take: $T$ isn't that bad. Yes a lot of the material is basic, and the TAs that mark the assignments nitpick, but there was a lot of information that genuinely helped me, such as the sections about navigating waterloo works during the coop process, how to format your resume/ cv, and how to approach an interview. I'd recommend completing the entire course within the first 3 weeks of the term, that way you will consume all of the content during your first coop cycle( which helps with your first coop search a lot), and you don't have to worry about the course for the rest of the term. With additional opportunities for bonus marks, its easy to get above a 60 % to get the credit( its a pass/ no pass course)

I really enjoyed learning the $T$ of this course. I've loved movies forever and this course really showed me how easily I could do it! However, there is TONS of reading involved since the prof doesn't teach in the lectures as much as review what she's expected you to already have read. The amount of reading was.. oohh so painful. If you aren't interested in becoming a filmmaker this would be a really heavy elective. The weekly screenings were fun at first, until the movies got weirder and weirder.. and the prof didn't provide any trigger warnings. She could have used WAY better films for examples, or not even made us watch the entire things because many of the examples we were supposed to draw from could have been shown as brief clips during the lecture( if she bothered to explain anything).

You definitely have to work hard throughout $T$, but it is a great introduction to Neuropsychology. It doubled as an intro to seminars, and research methods( in the assignments), but there are many opportunities to do well. Overall, as a psych major the material of this course carried with me to several other courses. I loved it.

Super straightforward. Nice guy, if you ask him for help $T$ loves to talk about the course. Goes off on a lot of strange examples. Offers extra credit on midterms. Just know the vocab, and you'll be fine. I recommend this class for anyone who needs GE credit or if they want to take an anthropology class.

My course is in $T$, which is amazing and beautiful. I have been witnessing it getting better and better from day to day. However, it could have been more complete if the internet in the forum could be improved. It was corrupted while I was listening to my recorded lecture sometimes- not sure if its because of the internet or any fault of Echo360. Furthermore, I think we should have more shops selling health food such as more choice in term of salad, smoothies, and low-in-calories snack and meal simply because many people are having healthier lives. Afterall, choosing UoE has been one of the best decisions of my life.

It's a $T$ that is somewhat useful but, really, if you're someone who already plans ahead for important things in life and can execute those plans( which most of us, at this point in life, should be able to do) then there's nothing new to be learned here. Focus on passing and spend the time you save on other courses.

$T$ usually does not take the easiest and clearest derivation in his presentation. But the content covered in his course is very interesting. If you have a background in theoretical mechanics, you would see that he mentioned the application of Nother's theorem in quantum mechanics. He introduced density matrix in this course, which is a very useful tool if you want to do AMO or quantum information. And he even taught you how to control a qubit!

The $T$ was pretty bland and very dry to keep up with. It's pretty much all textbook based since Professor Frayne doesn't really provide any lecture materials, but the textbook is absolutely awful. It's all over the place and a pain to make notes from. This term's breakdown was four 25% mc quizzes( open book& open google) and one 25% written test, where your lowest mc quiz mark is dropped and replaced with the written test mark.

$T$ was made to be online with how easy it was. Classroom lecture was pointless since all you needed to do was look at previous papers written by students to get an idea on how to write the paper. Does give 20 extra points at the end of the semester for perfect attendance however he adds 20 points to points available so the 20 points become moot

The absolute worst $T$ I have ever had. For his tests you literally had to fill in whole quotes from the textbook which was an absolute drag. I finally started to get the hang of his tests and he started gypping me points and would only give me a few points that I deserved back even though he would ADMIT that I should have received more

The $T$ in this course was very poor. For example, different TAs would give their students very different expectations. This was a big deal for one of the reports where some students were given the expectation that they must add a specific thing to their lab reports and others were left with the information that said explicitly not to do that very same thing. This resulted in many students losing over 10 % of their grade for that assignment despite it not being our fault. Honestly, if the communication had have been better, the course would have been substantially better.

$T$ was mostly a review of Che 100 with a little bit of Che 102 mixed in up until the midterm. Post midterm became a lot tougher, as this is when Energy Balances are introduced. Our class had a fairly high midterm average, so of course we were destroyed on the exam. However, we all came out with decent marks in the end( ride the curve kids). I voted this course as easy because in terms of the other courses that you'll take in the semester, it is one of the easier ones. However, be sure to do all of your practice and assignments, and be sure to show up to tutorials( you will get easy marks). Redoing the tutorial sheets and assignments is also very helpful for studying for the final exam.

The course is very useful, especially if you're planning to continue studying communications; $T$ rely heavily on ECE 207. Labs are interesting and well-organized. In general, I found the course easy to study for, but the sheer amount of material packed into it made it overwhelming.

This $T$ would rather complete the syllabus on schedule and have one-forth or less of the beginning class at the end of the semester than slow down , teach and reach down to the student's level of understanding. GET A TUTOR, TEXTBOOK AND THE SOFTWARE EARLY TO PREP FOR HER! Don't be afraid to ask questions in class or she will ZOOOOOM off...

Very fun $T$. You do need to keep up and argue with him in order to score points, and you do need to know your materials, but he is very fun. I find it funny that a pastor ( Prof. Coleman is a Pastor ) is teaching philosophy. All in all, an excellent class if you're willing to work.

$T$ was somewhat difficult, passed with a B+. There are 2 major tests( both worth 20%) and a final exam( worth 40%) and the remaining 20% is participation challenges and assignments. Majority of your grade depends on how well you do on the 2 midterms and exam so you REALLY got to make sure that you are well prepared before the tests becauses its a big chunk of your grade. The first 3 units were terrible, but the all other units were basically grade 12 chemistry with small new pieces of information, so those units weren't difficult. Piazza was really helpful and really got me through this course, it's a great platform to asks questions so I would suggest using that. This is the type of courses were you need to spend at least 2 weeks prior to a test reviewing all the units, you can't cram last minute, that doesn't work for this course, you seriously need to know your stuff so use the tools they provide, don't be scared to email the prof or TAs about questions, and ask peers for help. If you do all of that, you'll do well in this course

I took this course online, and taught by all 3 profs: $T$. They all have different approaches when teaching this course; it is just a matter of adjusting to their teaching style. Overall an easy course with a small expansion on SCH 3U from high school. Do NOT make the mistake I did and think that reading course notes, doing assignments and participation challenges are enough, especially if chem is a weaker subject. DO THE TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS, BUY THE TEXTBOOK. IT will help you a lot( in fact, a lot of the questions on the midterms were either similar to or exactly the same as the questions in the textbook). Furthermore, take advantage of the Piazza website, you can get answers from other students or the instructors in a matter of minutes.

Took $T$ cause it sounded fun. Thought we would be formally taught how to use real techniques to write calligraphy. It wasn't anything like that. We only ever practiced Arabic calligraphy once, and the rest of the time it was just talking about what art is. I'm sure some people would enjoy this course, the elitist art snobs, but not someone who actually wants to learn how to make art, rather than talk about it.

This $T$ will be useful only if you are gonna enter Storage Industry( e. g. data center, initiator, expander, target etc.) Teaches you parallel serial interface and protocol and other random stuff. The course content becomes messy when entering DAC and ADC. These are just for matching with content in 318. IMO this course should be moved to a hard core 4th year TE instead of a mandatory 2nd/ 3rd year course. 327 is way more useful than this. Labs are useless and painful to debug( hardware issue, project creating issue, random issues.. not your logic/ code problem!) which eventually makes the lab room a vortex of retardness.

$T$ is pretty easy if you go to class and pay attention to the lectures. The textbook readings can be pretty boring, so I'd suggest reading through the slides and then only focusing on textbook readings for the sections that aren't clear on the slides. Some people tend to thing that Audit is hard to study for- to a certain extent it is true, but you have you know the concepts and tests and what to do in what situation. The tests are usually a case, where you're asked to write a memo to the Partner or something, and you earn marks for the quality of your answer not just the quantity. So, a constant stream of BS won't get you many marks.

This course is all about evaluating" Q" from Thermo 1 and 2. Conduction and convection made up the majority of the course, while radiation was thrown in at the end. A fair amount of topics were cut based on time. Conduction was mostly 1D with some transient and steady state problems for different shapes. Convection is basically boundary layer theory and figuring out which correlation to use to solve a question. $T$ is a little more abstract. There's a lab that deals with internal flow in a pipe. There were lots of practice problems available, and the exams had similar questions.

This course now provides $T$. Your exemption does not expire, and it's the highest exemption level in Canada. This is a huge advantage, you'd be stupid not to take this course. Sure, the textbook / handbook and registration license is a lot of money. But if you did your exam/ studies through CICBV, it would be way more expensive. You save a lot of money from doing it with UW. This is the best course and the worthiest in the entire MAcc program. Also, unlike other courses where you don't really learn much new material, the CBV program is new knowledge and you'd be learning a lot. Valuation is an essential skill in both accounting and finance fields, and the CBV designation( plus its career aspects) is growing every year. By taking this course, you'd also be ready for CFE's valuation competency and really learn how to do a proper CCF / DCF. You're getting 3 designations ' competencies( CPA, CFA, CBV) in 1 course. In undergrad, they never taught how to do a DCF( you just memorize the format from 373's cases). Many times, I wonder why this course can't be introduced earlier because it is actually that useful.

make sure you do the study guide questions and go to review sessions and you will get a lot of practice questions from upper years
As my first advanced math $T$, I found this much harder than math135/137, but I'm glad I took it. It's pretty unconventional for a first linear algebra course, since we build up from the abstract foundations( instead of memorizing how to multiply matrices etc). 10/10

Professor Newburg is very interesting and funny. He explains clearly what he expects from students and he iss avaible when needed. I enjoyed going to $T$ and I cracked a smile every class. He is symphatheic and I reccommend him as a teacher, he aims to help students become a better writer

He is a really easy going $T$. The material is very dry but he tries to make it bearable. I took the summer session it was one midterm and one final both were essays. He gives the topics before the exam which allows you enough time to decide which essays to do. Overall enjoyed his class, easy compared to other profs at baruch.

Very smart guy, but this can cause $T$ to go off on tangents during lectures. The textbook is your best friend. Does not assign homework, but does give" suggested problems" that are not turned in for points. Only take him if you are interested in an in-depth understanding of Material Science, not for an easy A.

The Digital Logic+ Computer Design mishmash $T$ that seems to have come out of ECE and then punched a couple of times to be more friendly to us CSers. Easy means you just do a lot of diagram drawing, table filling, and adding/ subtracting. If you like the hardware side of things, this course is really interesting.

Science major and I found $T$ EXTREMELY difficult. Will put total blame on students when whole class fails exam. The lectures are fast & poorly explained. You are given 50 min to complete a 30-40 question exam& given hours of hw which won't be returned until weeks after exam. Doesn't know answers to own questions. Class beat me down.

$T$ was nothing like I thought it would be.. A ton of information is thrown at you with the assumption you are only taking the course because you want to be a personal trainer. The lab was useful in practicing the techniques discussed in lecture but it was expected of you to role-play trainer-client relationships.

I liked $T$ because it was easy, but I do not know if it was very useful for me because I didn't find it applicable, a lot of the theories seemed outdated or useless but I probably think that because I just wanted free marks and didn't ask questions. Most people will find this easy but you still need to do work to succeed, for an easy 90 + buy the study guide.

$T$ has a lot of very useful knowledge, but talked more about his glory days as a race car mechanic than he did on teaching us what we needed to know about the real world of rebuilding engines! He cherry picked the class on who he wanted to teach things to and the rest was left out in the cold. He manipulated the class to suit himself!

You have three quizzes every week. One lecture, two in lab. The $T$ aren't fun either, because while they are multiple choice E on everyone one of them is the answer is not present, so it's hard not to doubt yourself. If you take her, you better study your butt off before every test. Like you think you know it - that's not good enough.

I took $T$ during the pandemic and when i had my work term and it was a little difficult especially with the tests. Since it is a more advanced course i understand that the tests needed to printed however, this took away from our actual test time. Since i was also living away for my work term i did not readily have access to a printer, so it was just difficult trying to finish a 6 page test in about an hour with printing and scanning time deducted. However, for the second test the prof did shorten the test 4 pages so it made it easier to not rush through the package. Overall, an interesting course, but with its online nature was a bit messy.

Good $T$ to understand some fundamentals about macroeconomics. Prof. would always post example practice questions to work on and assignments are pretty much a carbon-copy of these so easy enough to get high grades. But you still need to do your own fair share of thinking for some of the tougher questions. Six assignments and no exams or quizzes so a pretty easy course to take, especially if you're on Co-Op.

$T$ was somewhat helpful as I did learn some tips about interviews and coop, but for the most part, it was fairly boring. Econ 101 review periods were only taught for one section of classes, and if you weren't in that class, it was usually a waste of time.

The day before a test she gives a lecture on what it is going to be on. However, sometimes $T$ lies.. Study the book and always look at the questions from the hmk, even if she tells you not to.

I took $T$ with Tan Dinh and found it very poorly organised and dysfunctional. You can take my review with a grain of salt because math and physics are subjects I am awful at, however, some important points. Every review you see here about how your TA makes or breaks the course and it wasn not a great time is correct. If your TA doesn't care and you've never done physics in high school, this course will be extremely hard and require a lot of studying in your free time, especially if physics isn't something that comes naturally. We were told by Tan to not ask questions and my TA would often ask my question back to me, tell me they weren't allowed to answer my question, or say something like" well would do you think" which isn't very helpful if you genuinely don't know what you're doing. I also found Tan very condescending? During the first lab, I was struggling with the" improvements for the lab" section and when I asked for feedback he essentially told me it was terrible, he's seen kids do better, and offered little feedback or suggestions. He also did not show up to the many subsequent labs so you're completely reliant on your TA( and I feel like I didn't have a great one) tldr: how much your TA likes teaching determines how much fun you'll have in this course, if you aren't good at physics please avoid at all costs. I sincerely hope this class is better in person.

The home works aren't that bad, just get it over with immediately. Seriously, we read almost everywhere and everyday and reading a chapter of a book and writing what you honestly thought about it won't hurt.

Very useful $T$ to give you an introduction to digital media and give your chance to try them( gif, glitch art, in-between images, etc) on your own. You could be very creative in that course and do whatever you want under the given subject. You have to explain the idea/ concept behind your work. The projects are fun, but the blog exercise( 1%* 10) could be boring. You could pull an all-nighter if you don't start you project earlier.

Covers basic psychological theories& terms, basically a review of high school content. Both textbook and lecture content was tested, so there were a lot of $T$, but concepts are relatively easy to grasp. It's not as easy as one would think a psych101 course is; be prepared to read and attend lectures, but provides a very solid foundation for other psych courses. Makes PSYCH253R a breeze afterwards since there's a lot of overlap in content.( taken in fall 2016)

Very nice professor and super lenient. Gives you the answers during in class quizzes and is flexible with deadlines. She really just wants to give all her students an A. When it comes to the midterm and final, it is a little tough only because of poor wording of the questions. Sometimes she does go a little fast as there is a lot of $T$.

$T$ is really boring. u cant even understand his notes the way he writes is really horriable( ex: triangle is an A) i had no tests in that class just a project at the end and he gave grades according to his memory if he remembers ur name and face. if u can be a friend with him u will get an A

$T$ is not necessarily easy but you can do well if you really drill down on the concepts. There are assignments almost every week marked for completion, 2 midterms and a final exam. the calculation questions on the midterms come straight from the assignments, but the M / C questions are KILLER. It is VERY similar to BIOL 359, so if you enjoyed that you will likely enjoy 479.

Took his Business 300 Online class. He waits until the last minute to write back to students, does not clarify on final project details, and does not give any input to the class at all.

Loved it ! $T$ were very responsive to questions on Piazza. Exams were fairly reflective of course content. Loved the content, though I wish solutions to practice problems were posted. Builds on a lot of content from MATH135 so it was a bit difficult for me at the beginning, but graph theory( the second half) seemed to be easier[ than enumeration] for most people in this course.

This is a bird course, but the $T$ is different during the pandemic where the class is all online. Instead of simple multiple choice midterm and finals, I had to write 4 essays total with a word count of 1250-1750 each with plenty of references. If you're taking the class online, be prepared for it to take some time out of your schedule that you would normally have.

ACCT 201A- Financial Accounting. Not much to say anymore, he retired at the end of Fall 09 semester. He is tough but he just wants every one to be as good an accountant as he is. He doesn't deserve all the criticism from other commenters. Do the reading, there are no shortcuts in accounting( and life). Enjoy retirement $T$.

Great $T$, only complaint would be about the quizzes. At the end of every unit students must complete a 15 question quiz in 20 minutes. They are manageable to do well on but rather stressful. There are also optional assignments which are easy and definite grade boosters( I had a 95% average on these assignments). The midterm was a breeze, but the exam was killer( and likely bell-curved since the final mark did not reflect the struggle). I highly recommend this course, especially with Dayeh.

I really enjoyed the $T$ and Ryan knows what he's talking about. However, he's not a very good advisor and he hasn't really helped guide me through the DIV process at all, which is a bit frustrating.

Difficult $T$ in the sense that it is EXTREMELY different from anything in high school- the topics are pretty abstract. Once things click, it's much more manageable. Very underrated imo.

Loved having $T$ this fall semester. She truly cared about the student success and pushed us in the class to do our very best no matter what. Her lectures were genuine and from the heart. This was not only just by helping us learn and understand the work given, but also by talking to us about real life situations. Wonderful professor.

She is a horrible $T$ who is extremely scatter brained. she knows a lot about art but does not explain well at all. Her tests are ridiculous.

Took the course in-person in Winter 2022. The required $T$ were an absolute waste of time. The lectures were incredibly unengaging and the course slides were borderline useless because most of the information was omitted so that we would have to attend lectures. I usually slept or did other classwork during lectures. To do the assignments, me and a couple friends would cram the textbook the day before the assignment was due and then figure out the assignment together right before it's due.

Very confusing and contradicting $T$. He is very invested in English as he sends multiple emails daily with tools to use for writing. Spends the whole class lecturing off PP and no in-class work time. Does not have clear guidelines for papers and if you ask for help understanding, will be told to refer to the syllabus. Awful experience.

Well planned and useful $T$ to strengthen your finance fundamentals. The material can be difficult if you are completely new to finance or a beginner, definitely go to lectures! The tutorials are amazing and provide hands-on opportunities to apply the learnings. It is an excel heavy course, so having prior excel knowledge will be beneficial, however a lot of excel tips and tricks will be shared during tutorials.

For a good month and more, I had like a 35 in the course and genuinely thought I was going to fail. I was preparing to retake the $T$ at a later date. And mind you, I did study for the midterm. At that point I started to put more into organic chemistry and highkey ignored all my other courses( one of the other courses I only watched the first 5 weeks of lectures). Ended with a low 70. It was hard and I hate myself for liking the course. Steven Forsey is such a good prof, literally people would ask the most ridiculous questions and he'd be so patient and nice answering them. Great at explaining too. I just hate how much this course is tanking my gpa:/

I think of this course as enemies to lovers... you will love this course because of the content, and discussions but hate it passionately as well because you quite literally will not receive 60 % worth of your final grades!!!!( participation, final paper and final exam). Brabazon stated that" this course is extremely hard" however it is not the course that is hard but the harsh markings, unorganized marks and lack of communication. Highly recommend $T$, I just wish there was better organization and less harsh marking for straightforward content.

Great $T$, provides a lot of real life examples, which stimulates the mind. Business= selling and making money, so it's a great class to learn how to market products. One of the more stimulating class I have had. One example, currency manipulation is like frugal and spending. If you have a lower currency, that's spending less and save more.

Being my first stats $T$ ever, I really struggled in the beginning with a lot of new concepts and techniques. As the course went on, things started to click, but nonetheless, it was still stressful. Probably due to the online lectures being hard to understand and essentially learning the entire course from the course notes. An overall good foundation for future stat courses.

The $T$ was not too bad, however, the midterms where a challenge since they consisted of writing out mechanisms and identifying the final product. I found writing out the detailed mechanism part of the midterms were much easier than trying to identify the final product and reagents simply because it just make sense for me. The second part of the midterms were more challenging because he just want the final answer and you might not have enough time to try to figure out how to get to it. For some, it might just click and for others it might not. Therefore, it splits the easiness level in half.

It's pretty interesting stuff though, the kind of stuff I thought I would be doing more of in chemical engineering. Turns out, chem eng is really just more math applied to industry. But I liked this course. Oh yeah, don't miss classes!

I don't recommend taking $T$. In the online version, the lectures are only about 30 minutes long per week and they only highlight important information but do not teach you anything really. You are expected to learn all the content from the textbook readings.( aka you have to teach yourself everything in the course basically) Most of the midterm content was found only in the readings and not discussed at all in the " lectures ". Online midterms were okay, but questions were all over the place. If you're a psych student, you'll probably find this course pretty tough as it is VERY sciencey and requires a ton of memorization. If you're a science student, take this course concurrently with BIOL 373 because there is a fair amount of overlap.

I took this course during Fall 2020, so quizzes were online, but the class was in person. The $T$ was super tough, especially the quizzes, where every question tries to throw you off guard, and the midterm was also super tough. The assignments were pretty easy, especially towards the end of the course, so I would encourage you to do your best on them, even though they may only be worth a small portion portion of your grade. The first half of the course is much more difficult than the second half of the course. In the second half of the course, you will meet concepts you may have already learned in high school calculus.

Super basic intro to GIS course. Concepts are not at all difficult to understand and the course assignments are super easy. Midterms and finals are memorization heavy, but the $T$ are not difficult at all. A lot of this content carries over to the advanced GIS courses, so pay attention! Course material was super interesting as well.

Overall, she is the average $T$. I don't think she makes the class on a personal level as I would like, but she does teach the subject matter and knows her stuff. I think I disagree with her style of teaching how to make presentations, but it's better than never learning how to publicly speak

This was his first year teaching 111, and $T$ was not very good until he gave us a survey on what could be improved. Notes aren't very helpful for assignments, but you can do them easily with examples in the textbook. Tests are hard!

Starts pretty slow and definitely gets bogged down by the design recipe( ow). Otherwise you'll see some decent $T$, and you'll get good at recursion( assuming you do the assignments).

She focused more on earning her own degree than helping us earn ours. She teaches this introductory course as if it were an upper level philosophy class. Sometimes she does not even have a lecture ready. She takes roll every day and $T$ are hard even if you really study. Don't recommend taking this professor.

I've always been bad at chemistry so the $T$ of this course for me was not a surprise. The course went much too quickly for me to keep up and I'd come out of lecture more confused than I was before. They started to used the" flipped classroom" approach in lecture where you do the background reading before class, then come into class and do a quick review of the lesson then jump straight into examples. This method worked for some students, but I was not one of them. My one piece of advice is to read the course notes and keep up. It's so easy to fall behind and extremely difficult to catch up.

I'm pretty interested in the field of Cryptography and Information Security so $T$ was pretty interesting to me! Alfred is a pretty awesome prof and he really tried his best to make this course fun and useful for his students. During the term I took it this course was also fully doable online, the lecture videos Alfred produced were by far the best I've ever seen. Like you could tell the prof put a TON of effort into making them enjoyable and engaging. Alfred is just cool like that. I'd say this course is definitely worth taking, it's not an easy bird course that's for sure but it's not hard either. Assignments were like puzzles so I enjoyed attempting to crack those. Lots of support was offered during office hours so make sure to take advantage of that. Take it!

$T$ has met expectations I did not even have before. Half of the lecturers for my course( Sports and Exercise Medical Science) were very knowledgable. The St Luke and Streatham campuses are not too far from the city centre. I enjoyed the societies( Muay Thai and Jiu-Jitsu). They allowed me to meet people from different backgrounds. My only complaint is the University Community Mental Health Team. I had 5 sessions with them for my Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder. It was very unhelpful as the nurse was always unprepared and seemingly inattentive.

Absolutely painful. We had the full work term report back in 2020, not the reflective one. Writing a full properly formatted $T$ took a huge amount of time, and depending on your co-op it was really difficult to frame as a research project. It was actually easier if you chose to write about an unrelated research paper. Nearly everyone failed the first draft, and we had to significantly edit to pass the final grading. It was a very useful practice for people planning on research in the future.

$T$( with David Jao) is worth taking if you are interested in how" real math" works. It is a significant time commitment( Prof. Jao expects~ 15hrs a week) but I think it is worth it. Lectures were great , very engaging. Jao is an excellent speaker and a very knowledgeable guy. I learned a lot and they were very memorable. Assignments are approximately 70% Coq proofs and 30%" numericals". Coq ( computer-assisted ) proofs are really fun and relatively easy to do once you get the hang of them. Don't be scared of the syntax or get intimidated at the beginning; it gets much easier as you get used to it. With Coq, you will discover exactly what" rigorous" really means. I know many classmates who wish they could use Coq in other classes because it makes them feel more confident in the correctness of their proof. The numericals are, as one reviewer put it," a different beast". You will probably spend more time on them than on the Coq proofs even though they are worth less. The premise of the numerical is that you are given a concept and some guiding questions about the concept, and you are asked to: 1. Provide correct answers to the guiding questions( which are typically pretty easy) for 40% of the marks 2. Extend your understanding by asking your own questions, doing your own testing with the concepts, and then coming up with conjectures, definitions, and proofs of your own for the patterns you find in your own exploration( 60%) This second task will take a long-ass time if you do it properly. But it is very rewarding and there is really no other course where you will get the same opportunity to explore content on your own and try to make your own conjectures for marks. It teaches you a lot about the essence of doing math research and it is also a lot of fun. It is considerably more creative than one might expect. Anecdotally, you can get a very good mark on numericals without proving a single thing; just finding cool patterns in the concepts and stating them. Overall, nice course!

Extend your understanding by asking your own questions, doing your own testing with the concepts, and then coming up with conjectures, definitions, and proofs of your own for the patterns you find in your own exploration( 60%) This second task will take a long-ass time if you do it properly. But it is very rewarding and there is really no other course where you will get the same opportunity to explore content on your own and try to make your own conjectures for marks. It teaches you a lot about the essence of doing math research and it is also a lot of fun. It is considerably more creative than one might expect. Anecdotally, you can get a very good mark on numericals without proving a single thing; just finding cool patterns in the concepts and stating them. Overall, nice course!
Coq
Positive
This course( with David Jao) is worth taking if you are interested in how" real math" works. It is a significant time commitment( Prof. Jao expects~ 15hrs a week) but I think it is worth it. Lectures were great , very engaging. Jao is an excellent speaker and a very knowledgeable guy. I learned a lot and they were very memorable. Assignments are approximately 70% Coq proofs and 30%" numericals". Coq ( computer-assisted ) proofs are really fun and relatively easy to do once you get the hang of them. Don't be scared of the syntax or get intimidated at the beginning; it gets much easier as you get used to it. With Coq, you will discover exactly what" rigorous" really means. I know many classmates who wish they could use Coq in other classes because it makes them feel more confident in the correctness of their proof. The $T$ are, as one reviewer put it," a different beast". You will probably spend more time on them than on the Coq proofs even though they are worth less.

I do not suggest taking $T$ unless you want to devote every free moment you have to studying. He keeps you past lecture mostly every time. You need to get to class early on quiztest days( which is atleast once a week). He is an EXTREMELY hard grader. Do not recommend if you work full time or have a busy schedule. Disorganized lectures.

Weekly quizzes are from the book. $T$ were multiple choice- and not very clear. Research paper was a drag. Make sure you turn in the" rough draft" and you should do fine. Unlike previous reviewer, there was a 60% on the paper but most students got a B or C on it. He grades on a curve overall. Attend lectures and you'll get an A.

Organization is a mess, quizzes were added only after midterms and vocal student request, which caused the midterm to be surprisingly hard.

Final was promised to be" from 2 to 2. 5 hours", but turned out to be another 10 hour extravaganza. Labs are really fun to work on, but gets quite long towards the end.

She's great at french and I can understand her, which is definitely good, but $T$ plays favorites like no other. If you aren't one of her favorites, it's extremely likely that she won't help you. She is a very nice person though, and for the most part a good teacher. Just a very difficult class.

$T$ successfully made econ 312 the worst class I've ever taken. Reads slides in a drone, reuses old hws, annoyed at questions, does not work through problems, makes exams that test algebra more than economics. In short: boring and useless. It's not difficult, but you don't have to learn anything to do well. Just regurgitate.

If you had a good Chemistry teacher in high school or friends that are good at chem you’ll do just fine. The course is broken down into 6 sections, with an assignment due every 2-3 weeks. Each section had about 3-5 lessons which you review in weekly lectures, then an assignment and tutorial sessions. There were also 3 tests all term, each test was all multiple choice and covered two of the previous sections( 1& 2, 3& 4, 5& 6). As long as you keep on top of lectures and assignments, and when you don’t understand continue to do more practice then you should pass this course.
I'm borderline on this $T$. It was not implementation or theory oriented like all the other CS courses I'd taken. It was all about writing essays and reading up about current issues in computing. The class is largely discussion based, so there aren't any lectures. You have to attend class to get attendance marks. You'll also do group presentations/ debates. The essays can be pretty lengthy as well, upwards of 2000-2500 words. Just a note that the prof said straight off that it was difficult to get higher than 90 on essays, and you can't just BS the papers and expect a high mark( like other writing heavy courses). It's pretty thick on analysis as well, so you could treat it as an English course more or less.

This $T$ is the standard EM1 course that all students in physics have to take. With a strong focus on electrostatics, you use the 1. 5/ 2 years of calculus that you've been building up to use it in this course. From vector calc to taylor expansions and differential equations, this is a great course to test your math-to-physics application. Great course, but it is a bit tough, especially at first, so don't give up if you're struggling because the whole class likely is.

Took $T$ as an elective and I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have much science background from high school either but they taught the course really well and there is very little-if anything-you need to clarify beyond the lecture notes. That being said, make sure to take good lecture notes because the words on the slides alone are not enough to easily build a good understanding, at least for me. If you review well before exams and attend class 90 is very doable.

Professor Ritzer is just amazing; he's caring, knowledgeable, and very easy to talk to. He does give LOTS of $T$, and handouts but every homework will help get ready for the exams and essays. I'm still sad he stopped teaching eng111 because I would love to take his class again.

I took $T$: Solving the climate crisis and i loved it. we mostly had discussions as a class or breakout groups and discussed readings she assigned to us. The class is mostly writing and demonstrating your opinion on the climate crisis.

I wish I had more than 350 characters. If your reading this, DO NOT TAKE $T$. Absolutly horrible class. She treats this 100 level class like a 400 level class. I can not believe she is a professor, she read the entire lecture from papers. Last time she made everyone take their phone and put them on the other side of the room. who duz that?

I am from the USA, so I am comparing my experience to my home UNI to my time at Exeter. My UNI in the US had a lot larger campus, and the gym/ rec building was free for students because it was part of the tuition. The buildings at my home UNI were also a lot more, and there were more facilities. There was a building for blowing glass, 3D printing, and other things for design. The $T$ isn't the best. My UNI had a lot larger library, and there was a lot more space for studying. The clubs / societies at Exeter almost all require money to join , and more money each time you want to go to a club event. My UNI back home allocated money to the different clubs, so many were free. The only time you had to pay for clubs at my home UNI was if you were going on a trip. My UNI back home doesn't have a student union. I did not interact with the career services in Exeter. One thing Exeter did better than my home UNI was the internet. My home UNI had some trouble with internet.

MATH 128( ONLINE) do the $T$. do the eol and projects and all that. some may be tough but trust me, you’ll need that practice. they gave us a cheat sheet in winter 2019; if you feel fucked and fall behind as people usually do in online courses, and don’t have enough time to learn everything, make sure to put important derivatives on your sheet. then, find practice assignments link on learn( should be somewhere I’ve forgotten). click on the assignment for each unit, enter random numbers as answers( v important, you need to answer every question), then submit. at the end, copy the breakdown of the questions on your cheat sheet and try to understand how the questions were solved. this is just last minute resort. I would say the final exam was a combination of the easiest type of questions from each unit. don’t sweat it.

Best taught $T$ and most fun I have had in 1B. Zack Cramer is a beast and definitely makes this course 10x better than MATH 117( Calc I) or any other course for that matter. Easiness: Considering exams are 24 hrs and weekly assignments are worth 40%, it's easy to get a 90 + in this course. Questions are also relatively straight forward with maybe the last question of any assignment worth thinking through. Usefulness: I haven't really seen calculus be used in a working environment thus far, but its used pretty much in every other course you take( ECE 106, ECE 140, etc.). So concepts like Multivariable integration are important to master.

$T$ started off pretty ok , but eventually became too fast and concepts were not very well motivated with lack of examples to see how they can be nicely applied. The assignments will also take a lot of time, and the final was a bit rough. By the end, the concepts we were learning felt useless and irrelevant to the remainder of the course. However, I will say that this course gives you a sense of intuition and understanding of where things comes from much more than 136 does.

It's hard to motivate yourself to do the $T$ when each is 2 % or something, but it really is important to keep on top of it. They only get harder and arguably the only way to guarantee that you'll do well on the midterm( since you WILL be asked to write mini programs) I personally found the exam to be much harder than the midterm, so you really need to use the midterm as a grade booster.

Read everything, attend class, remember the songs. Got 100 in this course.
This was our hardest course in 3A by far. $T$ started off easy with review of thermodynamics, then rapidly became dense and difficult to follow. Builds upon knowledge from quantum , which was 5 terms earlier and largely forgotten. The quizzes were long and each problem was very involved, leaving little time to finish. Most of us typically chose a low-weighted page and skipped it altogether to prioritize time. Required lots of study time to memorize every small equation.

This was our hardest course in 3A by far. Content started off easy with review of thermodynamics, then rapidly became dense and difficult to follow. Builds upon knowledge from quantum , which was 5 terms earlier and largely forgotten. The quizzes were long and each problem was very involved, leaving little time to finish. Most of us typically chose a low-weighted page and skipped it altogether to prioritize time. Required lots of study time to $T$ every small equation.

I took $T$ online, and the concepts were hard to grasp, the webex lectures were good. However the professors were very understanding and took the time to help you out aswell. Most of the marks in the class were participation and completion. The part of the course that was based on your answer was worth very little, so that even if you messed up it wasn't that bad. Ended the course with a 95 and I barely got all the concepts but I showed through the completion marks that I took the time to learn.

Wow. I really loved taking $T$! it was really hard but she was the first science teacher I've ever had who has had an answer to EVERY SINGLE question. If you have never taken a super hard AP science( ie C. AP mechanics, and electromagnetism) you are not ready for this lady. but if you pass her class , you can probably do anything in life.

Interesting $T$, but poorly organized( online, winter 2021). The entire course is essentially just them throwing the same concepts at you like 1000 different ways, so it’s easy to understand each concept on its own but pretty hard to see why they matter or how they connect with others. Also, not sure why they made assignments worth basically nothing but then hit us with a 50 % exam. Try to get Janelle Resch, she’s amazing!

Let me begin by explaining that I'm the kind of student that puts their head down and grinds when it matters, but isn't afraid to take time to have fun and keep a $T$. This class destroyed that balance. I spent countless hours every week trying to understand everything, and truthfully quite a but of it I understood after working towards it. I was never terrible at math, but there were those units that I definitely found harder than others. I didn't use the textbook past the midterm because my prof's notes stopped paralleling the content which made it difficult to teach myself - because yes you need to do that this whole course. Keith KILLED ME- I tried so hard being respectful in my emails but he almost broke me. So here's the thing about him... he gives good notes that he posts about the lessons and STUDY THOSE if you can. Those are what he bases exams and quizzes after. BUT- he also encourages students to work through problems on their own first to try and understand the material, which yes seems like a good idea, but he also has a policy of refusing to help students with questions when his quizzes are open- BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A QUIZ OPEN AND AVAILABLE- so this man NEVER answers questions which is extremely wrong because we as students are paying for him TO TEACH and how do we learn if he doesn't help?? 10/10 Recommend investing in chegg over the textbook for this course and don't be shy from Quizlet- trust me when I say it's a much better investment. For the midterm a tip is to throw multiple choice questions from past quizzes into a doc so you can just use ctrl+ f or command-f to search through questions. If you work your butt off you'll get through, but MAKE STUDY GROUPS- step away from your social anxiety and just do it cause dude everyone is suffering in this class, but asking questions between one another will be a life saver. Exams are usually 15 M/ C marks and 70 marks or so in problems.

Difficult, but interesting $T$. Biweekly assignments, midterm, and final. Please note- don't take this expecting CS341- course is much more theoretical and has lots of probability and statistics and is much more proof based without any implementation.

$T$ is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is willing to help , but not give you the answer. I have learned so much from her class. If you go to class and pay attention( don't need to read) and actually try... then you will do well. I don't know what the person below is talking about, she is fair. Very good professor.

Honestly the only people that will complain about this $T$ are the students who take more time to grasp concepts. She gets straight to the point and doesn't dwell on it. If you're into that kinda thing , shes the right person to go to( especially if you're proficient in math). AND SHE DOES ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS!!!-.-

$T$ was not an easy course, but the information that you learn will come back in other courses. I wouldn't recommend buying the textbook as we were usually only tested on the things discussed in lecture.

I took 1st and 2nd semester russian with her. She's an ok $T$, but not the best. She's a native speaker, a reasonable teacher , and a fair grader. but she can be very grumpy sometimes. not exactly the warm and cuddly type. She doesn't use blackboard at all. if you study and have good attendance , youll get an A. mediocre attendance equals a B.

$T$ is definitely a strange guy and loves going off on tangents.

Start assignments at least 2 days before they're due, and definitely start the project early.
The $T$ was pretty straightforward with online modules of a slideshow each week. But the professor gave us only 30 seconds per question on quizzes and gave some questions that would purposefully " trip up " students. Those were also his words. Kind of hard to get those questions right when you only have 30 seconds. The content of the course was decent and what you would expect.

I enjoyed $T$. He gives real life examples of what he's talking about and does little analogies that help you remember concepts.

Also, his quizzes are harder than his test

Essentially a continuation of PHYS 115, but with a more helpful $T$, exam problems that bear resemblance to what you see in the homeworks/ tutorials, and homework problems that are doable by the average Joe. Overall, this course is not too difficult as long as you keep on top of the assigned weekly homework problems. Additionally, make sure you complete the worked examples from the Hibbeler textbook since they are of great help, and make it easier to grapple the homework problems.

The most difficult and disappointing $T$ I've taken so far in my undergrad. The content is taught poorly with a lack of examples and insights that truly reflect the difficulty and intuition present on the written assignments and assessments. The only way you're going to get a high grade in this course is if you let it become a time sink- allocating many hours per assignment, going to every office hour, and going to every tutorial. However, this course isn't even that relevant for many students pursuing a CS degree here. The fact this course needs to become a time sink if you want to do well is a testimony alone to not just how poorly taught this course is, but how poorly designed this course is.

There was close to zero connections made to macroscopic chemistry or even subatomic particles. The course covers the Schrodinger equation, wavefunctions, and necessary associated math from the driest, math-only perspective. While I understand why it was necessary to cover all the basics of wavefunctions from the ground up, I found myself frequently getting lost and losing sight of what properties I was calculating in the first place. Fortunately, exam was open book.

Tbh just read and memorize the textbook for $T$. The content is easy but it's hard to do well because there is way too much content and it's impossible to remember everything. I found it way easier to do better in courses like microbio than this. There are 5 mini assignments where Pamela brings in kids to class and you have to guess their age and explain why you think they're that age and she gives you a+/- 1 month error for the age. There is also one main assignment due on the last day of class where u have to summarize an article and make it into a parenting magazine. I literally just taught myself everything before the 2 midterms by reading the textbook because the slides have very little detail. Overall if you are looking for an easy mark booster elective that does not require much work, I do NOT recommend this course, at least not with Pamela Seeds. In order to do well you need to study the textbook content like every day to stay on top of it, which is annoying when you have other more important courses to study for. Btw the class average for the second midterm was 69....

$T$, which is awesome. The lab reports are all template style, which you download off of the course's LEARN profile and then just complete it by typing in the box or drawing stuff in the box. Stick to the template font and stuff, otherwise you will get penalized. Marking of your lab reports varies by TAs, as some mark harder than others. But for the most part it's pretty easy to get at least an 80 + after the first template report when you get the hang of it.

The $T$ is useful, it shows me some justifications on what is different from what I learned in high school( something like 0^ 0= 1). The second part is annoying, since I didn't learn number theory in high school, so it's hard for me to cope with difficult questions. When it goes to Prime Number, there are questions I have no idea to get full marks( question itself is easy to answer, but no idea how to avoid losing partial marks, fortunately, TAs are willing to give full marks) The third part RSA( application on number theory) is really interesting. Overall, easy course with a high grade because there are 2 free bonus marks. The final exam is hard. Some questions you have no idea how to get full marks even if you know how to solve them. If you have done many proofs in high school, easy 90 + as an online course. Just using Excel to make a calculator. EEA helps a lot.

If you have done many proofs in high school, easy 90 + as an online course. Just using Excel to make a calculator. EEA helps a lot.

An interesting $T$ ruined by a terrible prof. Lectures notes were unorganized and difficult to follow. Lectures did not reflect material seen on midterm / final. An excessive amount of assignment questions assigned every week( >100 questions/ week on average). Many people in my year agreed they spent all their time struggling to finish assignments for this course while not learning a thing. Student feedback was definitely ignored on multiple occasions for this course. Could have been a lot of people's favorite course if not for the prof.

Much easier than Biol 240. I think the breakdown was like 30% Lab which consisted of like a 50% Lab final, and other lab stuff( quizzes, lab reports). 25% midterm and 45% final? I can't remember. Though the $T$ was much easier to memorize and was more straightforward than the Biol 240. The lecture component is easy, but what would brought my mark down was the lab component which should've been easy but I ended up in a section where the TA marked hella hard so it's kinda up to luck.

Fantastic $T$ dealing with American history through the scope of Rock n Roll. Begins with rock's origins in the blues of the segregated south, it's transformation north through the great migration of African Americans, and it's journey westward through the counter-culture era of the 1960s. The class touches on other genres such as Motown R& B& Soul, Funk, Grunge, and even Hip Hop.

In her into to motion pictures you will have a research paper and three small papers. There are four exams and you MUST study. If you study they are not that bad. There are short quizzes after each movie that are pretty easy. $T$ is fun and the teacher is very helpful and nice, but it is a lot of work so don't assume it's an easy A.

Amazing $T$. I stumbled into his class just to check it out and I ended up staying for the rest of the quarter. Yes, it's a 3 hour class but bear in mind that half of it is watching in class performances( which everybody will do at least once). Great class, gave me real insight on trial law all while having fun.

I took this class $T$, maybe that's not where he's suited. Never responded to any email I sent( 3 of them) over the semester, little to no communication via blackboard simply assigns multiple choice test per chapter EVERY week. Assigned 4 essay papers due at end of semester w / NO guide other than a topic out of the text, grades w / NO feedback.

Prior to taking $T$. I read the reviews and thought to myself that it couldn't be that bad. BOY was I wrong !! DO NOT TAKE this course with this professor. Take it with someone else!! She is NOT helpful. Walks away and leaves her students confused if you ask her a question in lab. Labs are confusing. I need more room to complain.

One of the worst classes that I have ever taken. Class is mandatory yet $T$ doesn't teach you anything, she stands in front of class and just makes you feel awkward because she really doesn't know how to teach us. Then she makes us do in class activities that do not relate to anything. Had to teach myself and her tests were not easy. do not take!

You are definitely able to get $T$ in this class. He has 4 assignments( 4x5= 20%), 2 papers( 10x2= 20%), 1 midterm( 20%), 1 final( 40%). The assignments are simple and short- I often did them the night before, it could be a Q& A regarding a film for example, or an activity( most people got 90-100s here). The papers are a bit longer, maybe 3-5 pages, but still easy( most people scored really high here). the Midterm has quite a bit of content to study, but its really not hard. just make sure you pay attention to the big concepts and definitions and the important people in history when prepping for the test. he offers a bonus paper for UP TO 5% extra on your grade( I believe most people got 2-4% extra here). the exam was very easy too, on the exam he had a bonus question for 5 % extra as well! Prof Adams reallyy does want students to do well and get high grades, so just make sure you attend class( its a must), put effort into assignments/ papers/ tests and you will do very well.

Pretty subjective $T$, as expected from a fine arts course. As someone with an art background I scored pretty well but if you don't have a good eye for aesthetics this class might be hard for you to do well in. Good introduction to Photoshop, tutorials were all great and helpful- Prof. Natalie selects which ones are relevant for each assignment so you don't have to just blindly guess at what to watch. Each assignment teaches you core PS concepts.

Study the lecture slides. No need to read the $T$ but he has extra credit questions on the exams that come from the book. Very nice professor, talks fast but podcasts. 1 midterm and 1 final.

Two tests, four quizzes and 4 case assignments. The $T$ is not the easiest but you can do well if you really try. The quizzes are quite easy, non-cumulative and you do better if you work with others. Your questions won't be the same but you'll doubt yourself less. Case assignments are also easy to get perfect on, the rubric is given in advance so do the readings and have your notes open while your group works on it. This course is definitely more geared toward kin students since there's lots of info assumed you know on exercise and it makes it difficult. The tests were also pretty hard so know your stuff.

Two tests, four quizzes and 4 case assignments. The course is not the easiest but you can do well if you really try. The $T$ are quite easy, non-cumulative and you do better if you work with others. Your questions won't be the same but you'll doubt yourself less. Case assignments are also easy to get perfect on, the rubric is given in advance so do the readings and have your notes open while your group works on it. This course is definitely more geared toward kin students since there's lots of info assumed you know on exercise and it makes it difficult. The tests were also pretty hard so know your stuff.

This is about the average $T$ encountered throughout mechatronics engineering. I'm a 2022 graduate and took this course in 2017, if that's a helpful reference. Complex numbers return for signals courses later, and vectors come up in advanced calculus and in signals courses.

Very helpful and flexible. Comp I and II, and World Lit I. $T$ can be a tad bit boring, but I've had her for all my classes because I know she is the best. I've had her in class and online and she was great either way. She is really easy with her grading and I would recommend her to any one who struggles with writing.

Wasn't such a bad $T$ this term. The content for propositional logic was pretty interesting actually. Course started ramping up at predicate logic, and got pretty boring honestly. I don't really care about soundness and completeness. Though if I had to compare this with MATH 135, this course is definitely better. The proofs you do aren't really the same nature, so if you hated 135 then at least this course isn't any worse.

STAYY AWAYY !! I took $T$ for an easy A and it proved to be a pain. Take another class for requirements because this class is for those who are really into this field. Having other hard classes and this class was very hard because I had to leave Extinction as the last class I had to worry about. My TA graded papers way too hard.

Very weak $T$. Does not like when kids are too ambitious with their projects. During a critique she'll say all sorts of sweet things to your face but when it comes to evaluations you'll see the total opposite come out. I didn't learn anything. She's a waste of time -- and money.

Took this online in W21. Course breakdown: participation x4( 20% total), reflections x6( 60% total), research essay( 20%). The $T$ was pretty interesting. We were free to do whichever assignments we wanted, as long as we did the minimum amount required. Also, since we're still in the middle of COVID, there was an automatic 1-week extension for all assignments( except participation posts).

It comes easy to those who already have an interest and the motivation to learn it( as with most languages). There's a bit of a curve at the beginning to learn all the $T$, after that it is memorizing vocabulary and grammar structures which isn't bad. Overall a really fun course because both the prof and tutor are really enthusiastic, and you get lots of chances to practice speaking through pairwork. Also for those wondering: a physical textbook is required for this course because you spend a lot of time directly reading from it in class.

As a result of this, I personally found the $T$ to be quite dry, and had a difficult time grappling the topics, especially the ones where we must design flip-flops from a truth table , and assembly language.

Hands down, the most clear and helpful $T$ I've had here. He doesn't overload you with work, but the assignments you get will teach you well, and if you follow instructions, you get the grade you deserve. He is also understanding when you have an issue. Great class, learned a lot!!

Probably one of the top professors I've ever had, $T$ is always entertaining and he's always willing to help no matter how late. If you're struggling at all go to his office hours he's extremely helpful.

$T$ is a good place , but with its limitations. Exeter has lost something about its self that many universities have maintained through COVID. I hope Exeter can rebuild its reputation as a great university in the future

Great $T$. Make sure you study whats on syllabus.

Very easy $T$. He gives you all the power point presentations, which come directly from the book. Quizzes are take home and open book/ notes. Very flexible and has a lot of knowledge on the subject.

You can hardly call this a class because it is a complete waste of time. All you do is read a chapter, memorize definitions, take a quiz right after, take an 3-4-chapter exam on those definitions and forget all you read once you are out of class. On top of this he is a boring $T$.

I have had this guy for 2 days and I all ready know $T$ is really smart but too smart to teach kids. Going to be a rough semester for me since I will have to teach myself!

If you did accounting in high school, there's no need to study whatsoever until the final exam, because the last two or three weeks introduce new material. Even then, I didn't study it and still finished with a high 80s. $T$ shouldn't take you more than two hours.

A very easy, but also very boring $T$. Lots of reading and the occasional in-class films. Personally did not find the material very interesting, but it makes a good bird course.

$T$ were not particularly clear- many students were confused. Students ' confusion was seen as laziness or fear of unstructured learning. Lack of motivation to focus on the course with other pending deadlines was evident. I ended up not attending very many classes or worrying about this course at all until near the end of term, aside from figuring out my group.

Choose your $T$ wisely. Ask for help when you need it. Make sure you make friends in the lab so you have someone to go to in case your TA is like mine.

The content that should have been taught in this course would have been very very useful for co-op search and technical interviews. Unfortunately, the $T$ did not deliver all the content. I'm not sure if she went over all of it, but the content wasn't in depth or anything. Not much coding or implementing practice, mostly just looking through slides that had not so great descriptions. The assessments were easy, but what's the point of having an easy course that doesn't teach you the content properly. Prof assumed we knew how to code in C ++, many including myself did not. Overall, this course was really disappointing.
